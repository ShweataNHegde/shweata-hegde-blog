The week was probably one of the most colourful weeks of 2024. December was indeed an interesting curveball I wasn't expecting.

The last day of Organisational Dynamics. Started as usual at 0900. The lectures were boring, honestly. In the afternoon, we were given the final group assignment to express creatively the learnings from the course. Although I was initially hesitant, I ended up dancing with the group. It was definitely a memorable experience and am super grateful to my team.

The day got exhausting as we continued with lectures and finale activity of being grateful to each other. The class became incredibly noisy and I left slightly earlier. I also had to pack to go back home.

Packing did not take as long, thankfully. Pravin was around as I packed, so it was not a boring activity either.

However, I could not sleep. I had dreamt of going home probably every day since the second month of staying at Ashoka. The day had finally arrived...

I woke up at 0430 and got out of bed at 0515. I pooled a cab with a fellow Fellow, Jahnavi. My flight was at 1145. We reached the Delhi airport surprisingly early at 0715. After security, I stopped by at Carnatic Cafe for Masale Dose. It was yum. After a quick round of shopping, I napped for a bit before heading to my gate. The flight ride was quiet. I only regretted not getting my neck pillow. But my anticipation made me restless, and I wouldn't have slept well anyway.

I felt overjoyed reading Bengaluru Airport written in Kannada. As I stepped out and took the first breath, I could not help but smile under my mask. Distance does make you grow fonder to your home land. I got my luggage and walked out of the airport. Adrian had booked a guest room for me at BLiSc as my plan was to stay there for a night.

After having a delightful small talk in **Kannada** with the cab driver, I made it to inSTEM gate and was greeted by Adrian.
