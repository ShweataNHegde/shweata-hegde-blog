The new term finally began :) After tireless days working on ELM presentations, game nights, interviews, essays and assignments, we made it out of the busiest period of the Fellowship.

I was really excited (I still am) for all three of my courses: 
1. Design Thinking and Innovation
2. Language Politics and Society
3. Sustainable Development: How Can We Align Social Justice, Biodiversity Conservation and Climate Action 

I think this will be one of my favourite terms after term 01 where we had statistics and history.
