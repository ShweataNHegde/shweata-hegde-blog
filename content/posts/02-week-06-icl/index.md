I started this tradition of writing to myself on my birthday in 2022, as a way to wrap-up my year and feel proud about how far I had come. Looking back, it was indeed one of the formative years where I was taking baby steps to learn about the world and my abilities. I still remember the 10th of November from 2022, the tired me in green saree finishing of her day at school, deciding to stop by at the library to write. She had dreamt of something big that day, and the following year, her dreams had indeed come true as she celebrated her birthday in Geneva with Peter in 2023.

Then, things changed, for the worse. Nothing seemed to make sense. I was reduced to tears refelcting on my 2024. Set-backs with applications, personal struggles, family, love.

But I think, for the most part, I have bounced back in 2025. It is still hard to believe I am in London doing this Master's that I had my eye on since my undergraduate. Life does have its ways of giving back.
