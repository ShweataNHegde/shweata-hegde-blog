I'm in the middle of the exam season. I have an exam in two hours. But here I am, sitting on my bed facing the same pink curtain and the fairy light, reflecting on my time in Room No. 122. In a week, the room won't be mine.

I couldn't help but wonder about the stories the room holds, stories that I (or anyone who comes next) will never know. The hostel is close to 70 years old, which means more than 150 people lived in this room before me. And every person, inevitably, must have filled the room with have been filled with laughter, heartbreaks, gossip, love stories, fights, and more. 

Of course, I have contributed to the room's collective memory by growing so much as a person. Sitting on this bed, I developed my website and indiaaskswhy.org, single-handedly planned a major event (Climate Knowledge Hunt Hackathon Sep. edition), and conquered my stage fear by taking demo classes. I also made new friends and connections and hosted private concerts for my gals :)

I also raged in anger when the water in the washroom stopped so many times. The wing has water issues; incoming people stay warned. I've agonized over studying useless and outdated stuff and doing pointless assignments. But I learnt to be patient.

122, thank you for keeping me sheltered while I brewed crazy plans. My gals, I'm grateful for bearing with me. I cannot imagine my hostel life without you two -- Kir and Nav. 

I've lost and found myself multiple times. I lived my life here, and it's time to leave. The room will hit a lull now. But not for long. The new kids with wild dreams will soon arrive to revive this pink-walled windowless room (yes, there is one broken window) and add to the room's ever-increasing memory.
