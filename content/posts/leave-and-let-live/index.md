I'm in the middle of the exam season. I have an exam in two hours. But here I am, sitting on my bed facing the same pink curtain and the fairy light, reflecting on my time in Room No. 122. In a week, it won't be mine.

The hostel is close to 70-years-old that means more than 150 people must have stayed in this room before me. I can't help but wonder about the different stories the room holds -- stories that I'll never know. Every year, the room must have been filled with laughter, heartbreaks, gossip, love stories and fights. Maybe they made their best memories in this room? Or their worst. Or none. 

I surely have made memories. I've grown so much as a person. I've developed this and the indiaaskswhy.org website, planned a major event -- Climate Knowledge Hunt Hackathon, conquered my stage fear thanks to the plans I made sitting on this bed, made new friends and connections, and hosted private concerts for my gals :)

I also raged in anger when the water in the washroom stopped so many times. The wing has water issues; incoming people stay warned. I've agonized over studying useless and outdated stuff and pointless assignments.

But seriously, 122, thank you for keeping me sheltered while I brewed crazy plans. My gals, I'm grateful for bearing with me. I cannot imagine my hostel life without you two -- Kir and Nav. 

 I've lost and found myself multiple times. I lived my life here, and it's time to leave. The room will hit a lull. But that's only until the new kids with wild dreams arrive to revive this pink-walled windowless room.
