Week 06 of the YIF. I have been meaning to document learnings since Week 01, but I never found the time. Including a new habit into your schedule takes effort.

## Made my CV
Today, after struggling for many months to perfect my CV, I finished creating one. I was asked by a professor to share my CV so he could look for a potential PhD advisor if I'm interested in pursuing one. I used [Superset CV builder](https://joinsuperset.com/). Although it was clunky (with edit widget being too small and it taking forever to load), it helped me format my CV and restrict it to a page. I don't know if I've done a good job at describing my work experience. We were asked to use the PAR Framework (Problem-Action-Result), but I got to lazy and copy-pasted details from my older resumes and modified a bit for consistency.

## Classes
In our Leadership class, we went over what Mission, Vision, Strategy and Values were. It seemed like the professor had gotten Mission and Vision swapped when he explained. In the later half of the class, we discussed what liberal arts education really meant.

_Notes I took while reading Surely You're Joking book on the side_

I didn't pay much attention to the history class. We were critically examining Rasosundari Devi's autobiography, My Life. We discussed what we can and cannot conclude from it about the lives of women of the time, what an authetic piece of historical document is, what questions to ask before making inferences from such texts, etc.

# Readings

### [Paper] Many Analysts, One Data Set: Making Transparent How Variations in Analytic Choices Affect Results
A well-written paper on crowdsourcing analysis of data. Same data, same research questions and multiple teams. What the researchers who crowdsourced found was that even when everyone uses the same data and make well-meaning defensible decisions on the statistical approach to tackle the question, there is a significant variation in the answers they get.
