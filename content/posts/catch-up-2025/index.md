I meant to write more frequently, however, it seems like I have not managed to be disciplined enough yet again. As it is always the case, a LOT has happened. Any attempt to capture or document these few months would be an unfruitful exercise. Instead, I will quickly summarise some key events before resuming my usual weekly updates.

## Term 4 (2024-12-24 to 2025-01-10): Making videos after videos!
After returning, I was immersed into a block-taught course called Visual Storytelling and Cinematic Techniques. Looking back, it was a very useful course. I, for the first time, learnt video production and acting. From direction insights such as camera angles, shot types, cutaways, continuity, to technicalities of video editing---we learnt it all. Naturally, the classes were quite intense, packed from morning to evening. Additionally, our ELM had added responsibilities of preparing for the India Science Festival, where we were showcasing the board game version of Pralay. I still remember those cold and gloomy winter evenings, when I forced myself to get out of my room to meet the team to discuss the logistics of making the game. It all came together at the very last moment.

## Going to the India Science Festival, Fergusson College, Pune (2025-01-11 to 2025-01-14)
I was such a chaos by the time India Science Festival came. I was unwell and burnt out. It was evident to others, too. For example, I forgot to take my laptop out at security. I kept obsessing that I had forgotten to pack the game tokens. I was also getting used to travelling with people, the last time I did that was back in May 2023 (Delhi Hackathon :P). The first night stay was a misery. We had booked a shady hotel, where cockroaches and other insects greeted us. Luckily, I convinced my team to book a better hotel for the next two days, and that made for a better Pune experience.

Running the India Science Festival booth was such an experience. We had so many people pouring in. We estimated that around 500 people played the game over the two days. I felt a bit useless because I could not speak Hindi. I am also not a people-person, I realised. However, the team did brilliantly, engaging the audience, keeping them captive. There were caveats, but it was one of my peak science communication moments of all time.

Met some famiiar people and made some new acquaintances. The highlight was meeting Tuttu. I am so glad I met her despite how busy and tired I was.

## Term 05 (2025-01-15 to 2025-02-19)
### Prof. Vijay and Prof. Butalia
I started the next term immediately after returning from Pune. I was quite excited for Prof. Vijay's first class and he did not disappoint. Along with his course on Climate and Geopolitics, we also had a course on Women, Society and Chaning India taught by Prof. Urvashi Butalia. YIF normalises having professors who are stalwarts in their fields. Where else in India do you get to take two courses by Padma Shri awardees in the same term?

However, as fate would have it, I fell sick. A really bad case of stomach flu (it could have been a bacterial infection, too, I will never know). I lost almost 15 days of January to it. As a result, I lost touch with the courses. Prof. Vijay's class got too political unlike the first class on developmental biology and evolution, and Prof. Butalia's classes were not accessible due to my lack of familiarity with the discourse.

### Friends of YIF
As the term 05 progressed, we got really busy with Friends of YIF, a live production hosted annually by all Fellows. It was one of the few things I looked forward to at the YIF. I gave my name for classical music and the end-performance. Overall, it was fun working on the performance. Learning a new keerthane took me back to my school days. It also made me realise how rusty my singing and knowledge has become. The rehearsals were intense and long. Never would I have imagined myself sleeping at 0200 for consecutive nights. As always, it all came together and the performance turned out great. It was livestreamed on YouTube and my family enjoyed my performance as well. Honestly, I was a tad bit upset that I did not get a solo performance, but I learnt a lot by working with the team.

### Good News
After the Friends of YIF, we were back to Term 05 classes. Exactly a week later, as I was about to go to sleep on the 14th of Feb., I got an email from Chevening. I was in disbelief reading "Congratulations" in the title of the email. I had been shortlisted for the interview! Just when I was about to give up on my dream to do Masters in Science Communication. To celebrate, I managed to sneak in a visit to Delhi. Arushi and I visited Humayun's Tomb and marvelled at Islamic Geometric Patterns. It was a fun day out.

## ELM Immersion Week (2025-02-20 to 2025-03-01)
The immersion was not so stressful. We worked mainly on design of the board game and aesthetic. Slow but steady progress. Nothing too fancy. I tried but failed preparing for Chevening. I also tried drafting my Inlaks application, and could not make much progress on it either. It is what it is.

NThat covers it all, I think. It took me roughly an hour to write, not too bad. Not many images to add. Might find some later.
