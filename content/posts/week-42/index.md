I never quite managed to post here again, despite having a rather light term. Times have changed very much. I think it's safe to say that I don't think I will ever have a 'normal' educational experience, without any global challenges jeopardising it. India-Pakistan conflict has intensified over the last week. My heart goes out to all the people the bordering regions on both sides. Although I am priveleged enough to not having to worry about a missile hitting my building (not yet, at least), I still can't help but be anxious, consume as much news as possible. I want to go back home. I am worried that I might get landlocked if I don't act swiftly. But, on the other hand, I feel guilty whenever thoughts of fleeing down to the south comes to mind. What about those who don't have the option of traveling back home? What of those who cannot afford to go back home? I feel selfish for choosing me over others.

We are in the last week of term 07. We have assignments, but my mind keeps drifting....

Some days have passed since I wrote the preceeding paragraph. Situation seems to have stablised. Of course, you never know what might come next. I am back to attending classes, doing my assignments. In particular, I enjoyed working on Language Politics group assignment. We made a zine where researchers (including studentts, us) are in conversation with Greison's Linguistic Survery of India. Today, we won the best presentation prize in the Design Thinking class for our new revolutionary restaurant idea. Little wins, counts. I don't know what they count towards, but yes.
