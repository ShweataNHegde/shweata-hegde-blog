An announcement long due: I am starting my Master's in Science Communication at Imperial College London as a Chevening Scholar :))

Ever since I started watching YouTube as a 13-year-old, I had one dream: studying abroad. I used to religiously watch the study-tubers of my time, hoping I would one day have a routine like theirs studying science in universities like Cambridge, Oxford, etc. It is so funny looking back at that naive version of me, she had no idea how difficult chasing that dream would be.

With little family support or formal guidance, the road ahead was going to be a solo-marathon. Parents did not want me away from home, which meant I had to study undergraduate in Mysore. I studied biology and education. Classes and professors were out of date by many decades, the college did give me plenty of time for my own explorations. That's how I met Peter Murray-Rust (#semanticClimate), who single-handedly changed my life. We struck a chord as a good mentor-mentee pair. Soon, we grew extremely close, and I found myself having someone who actually believed in me. My ideas suddenly had wings to fly, and they did.

I found my passion for science communication. I co-founded IndiaAsksWhy, which made me realise that I could actually "do" things, and make a difference in people's life. I also ran many events for #sC. As my undergraduate came to an end, my dream to pursue Master's abroad had a new found meaning. I wanted to study science communication from the best place in world, which co-incidently happened to be in the UK where Peter lived.

After graduating, I spent a year working in Bangalore while also making Master's applications. I struggled. I did not know how to craft essays (naive me thought I was a good writer), I had no real experience with interviews, I did not know whom to ask for support. Luckily, I got into all universities I applied for. Funding had extreme competition. Not surprsingly, rejections came, one by one. None of my scholarship applications had gone through.

Reluctantly, I took the only viable offer I had on hand. The Young India Fellowship (YIF). Bangalore had given me some sense of what science communication career would been like for a young professional like me, and the future wasn't looking great. The YIF, I thought, would give me more exposure. But, by this point, I had fallen very sick, and was not sure if I was going to survive North India. I decided to give it a shot, anyway.

The YIF turned out to be a transformative experience. It was the most difficult year of my life, yes, but I also learnt so much. Eventually, through Pralay, the climate board game, I also found myself coming back to loving science communication. Amidst the crazy schedule, I applied to Chevening scholarship again. I cancelled going home for Diwali to work on the application. I remember feeling so lonely in the hostel, while everyone was home. I knew I would make it to the interview, and I did. The next two months, all I thought was Chevening. However, I was a deflated balloon after the interview and convinced myself I would never get it.

Cut to the last day of the Fellowship, I had an email to open. Congratulations, it read. That was it. I had made it. Close to a decade of dreaming, and I was finally going to the UK.

On the day of writing this, I am leaving home to London. I suddenly found myself singing a long-forgotten song, "Fight Song". The song I listened to as a high schooler, beleivng that I had everything I needed to dream big. The song continues to inspire me. After a decade since I first listened to the song, here I am telling myself, "I might only have one match, but I will make an explosion."

I am extremely grateful to mentors and friends: Peter, Arushi, Karthik, Karan, Vijay, Ruchi, Megha, Anand, YK, Soumya, and all the Chevening scholars who spoke to me.

Onwards and upwards. Sparkle.
