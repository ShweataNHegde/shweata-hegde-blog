An announcement long due: I am going to Imperial College London for Masters in Science Communication as a Chevening Scholar :))

Ever since I started watching YouTube as a 13-year-old, I had one dream: studying abroad. That is  most of us from aspirational class. I used to religiously watch the study-tubers of my time, imagining I would one day have a routine like theirs in universities like Cambridge, Oxford, etc. I wanted to become a scientist. But, that naive version of me had no idea how difficult chasing that dream would be.

With no family support, peer guidance, or a set path to follow, the road ahead was going to be a solo-marathon. Instead of giving up, I decided to prepare for the run anyway. In retrospect, I have no idea, how I had so much belief in myself (something I wish I had now).

Soon enough, I started finding help. The more I seeked, the more I received. I had the privilege of being supported by many mentors, and through the process, I found my passion for science communication. I co-founded IndiaAsksWhy, which made me realise that I could actually "do" things, and make a difference in people's life, and contribue significantly to advance a field. I wasn't running the marathon by myself anymore.

As I finished my undergraduate (which was very disappointing), I thought I had trained enough, decided to run the marathon. But boy, was I not ready for the challenges ahead. I spent a year working in Bangalore while also making applications. I struggled. I did not know how to craft essays (and I thought I was a good writer), I had no real experience with interviews, I did not know whom to ask for support. I was panting, half way through the marathon.

Rejections came, one by one. All major scholarships, I did not get through.

I am leaving home to London tonight. I suddenly found myself singing a long-forgotten song, "Fight Song". The song I listened to as a high schooler, beleivng that I had everything I needed to dream big. The song has inspired many of us, hopefully, it will continue to inspire many more. The song continues to inspire me. After a decade, here I am telling myself, "I might only have one match, but I will make an explosion."
