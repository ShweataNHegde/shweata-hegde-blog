Late update. But three weeks ago, YIF came to an end. The last few days were spent packing, talking to people, music practice, more packing, and some crying. Just like that I was home. The YIF for me was the people; people who supported me, reassured me, helped me, and with whom I shared memories with. I am going to miss them. But I am also glad I am out of the place. Too much of falling sick, not eating enough.

I do feel like a very different person from what I was a year ago. I am more aware: politically, economically, entreprenuerally, culturally, and as a human. I could not be more grateful to all the professors, TAs and my fellow fellows.
