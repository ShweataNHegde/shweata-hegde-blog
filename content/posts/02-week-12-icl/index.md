## 2025-12-15--iPad Day
The week started with a trip to the Oxford Street Apple store. I bought an iPad for myself (Air, M3, Purple, 256 GB). I have been contemplating on getting one for the past year, and I finally convinced myself it was a good investment. I am loving the experience. Hopefully, it will come of good use when I start working on my dissertation next year.
