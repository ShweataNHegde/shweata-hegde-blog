## 2025-12-15--iPad Day
The week started with a trip to the Oxford Street Apple store. I bought an iPad for myself (Air, M3, Purple, 256 GB). I have been contemplating on getting one for the past year, and I finally convinced myself it was a good investment. I am loving the experience. Hopefully, it will come of good use when I start working on my dissertation next year.

Although I had a disturbed sleep (the same natural disaster nightmare), I woke up feeling fine. Headed downstairs to have breakfast, journalled until it was time to head out. In our itinerary was Wren Library, Quakers meeting, and Street Party. Peter and I were out by afternoon. As we walked towards city centre, Peter narrated the history of religion in Britian, I followed along as much as I could. 

We first made our way to The Wren Library in Trinity College. Having seen Trinity in videos, it felt surreal to be there in person. After reaching the library, we were told that we weren't allowed to get in through the college since Peter wasn't a member. Trinity is where Newton was, so I was quite excited about my chance of seeing some of his work, and I did! They had _The Principa_ on display along with Ramanujan's work. We also saw many other artificats such as Jane Austen's books and A.A. Milne.

Next, we headed to Quaker House for lunch with Peter's friends Kay, Roland and others. They were absolutely lovely people; the soup and bread was nice. I did not know what Quaker meetings were, but had said yes because Peter does not really give me choics anyway. After food, we left to the meeting room where chairs were placed in concentric circles. Peter instructed me that we would sit in silence for half an hour; people would speak if they felt like. I was very anxious for the first few minutes, but then my thoughts drifted away into thinking about my personal life (and miseries). In the end, Peter and Kay spoke about a Quaker who had been jailed for activism. We were served tea right after. I met more lovely people including an architect who suggested I visit Cambridge's mosque.

On our way back home, Peter narrated Quaker's history, and I was more and more drawn towards the religion. Previously, when Roland was asked about what Quakerism meant to him, he said it was thinking about the wellbeing of people. I should probably read more about Quakers.

On reaching home, we were tasked to make snow flakes from paper. We spent an hour chatting and cutting. It reminded me of festive season back home, when we people get together for shared activities. The street party went okay. We had about half a dozen neighbors turning up; one of them did block art, and I was fascinated by it.

In the evening, Peter and I watched _Sita Sings The Blues_, an animated satirical take on Ramayana. It was a light movie, but boring at times. We made omlette for dinner and slept.
