Yaay, I think I have had a mostly successful first week of classes. This term comprises of two components: three optional modules and one group project. For the modules, I have chosen: Science And Policy, Narrative, and Museums. Exciting! 

Since I also have this new iPad, there is novelty in doing everything: reading, taking notes, writing emails, planning, etc. I recently also discovered the seemless integration between Mac and iPad; I am yet to harness the full power of having two screens, one being touch screen.

First day, I made it to class early. Temperatures have dropped significantly, but getting up at 0800 was not as challenging as I anticipated. South Ken and Imperial looked gorgeous with clear blue skies. As soon as I entered class, I received sweet candies from Cat and a new year's card from Wannes (which was very sweet and kind!). I was also so happy to be back with my classmates; I had weirdly started missing them by the end of the break.

The only class for the day was Policy. I had made thorough notes from my pre-readings, so I felt prepared for the class. Having worked in science communication for a while, almost all conversations have ended in mentioning of need for policy changes: be it to draw more funding, or solve a problem, etc. However, I have never quite sat down to truly understand the appreciate the complexities of the policy landscape. The class is helping me with just that. The lecturer, Vicki, is amazing. She also speaks fast, so I could not really make notes. Her slides are detailed. I have made a summary of the class in a different post.

Post class, some of us from class had lunch together. Wannes, Shweta and I sat for longer chatting. Wannes and I spent more time on figuring out the open chemistry event I might be running with Henry and Peter. We left late afternoon to make our way back home after I got my free hot chocolate. We stopped by at the book store, when I received an email from Imperial reception saying they had found my Oyster card. I went back to Imperial to pick it up. Then, I decided to sit there and work till evening. I did a bunch of admin tasks, and freaked out after getting to know that Flora Graham from Nature Briefing is giving the seminar in the coming week!

I had a relaxed meal after coming home, re-read the readings from Narrative and went to bed.

Morning began with a call from GP. It turns out have an iron deficiency. Explains fatigue. On Iron Replacement Therapy now.

We had an intro to dissertation lecture in the lunch hour. It was a very useful session; I know what is expected of us. Having never written a dissertation before, it feels daunting. I have also been experiencing a mental block in terms of generating ideas, which is stressful.

Narrative class was next. It was fun; breaking down what narrative really means; it is not as easy as it seems from the surface level. Felicity has a way of bringing forth profoundness in the ordinary, and the class achieved exactly that. The class also made me reflect on my own writing as well, including this blog for instance. Can I call it a narrative piece? There are definitely narratival elements such as descriptions, casual relationships between events, character (mostly me), narrator (me), a physical space and time where all the events occur. Therefore, I do think the blog is more than just an explanation or a chronicle. It would be interesting to analyse if it fits one of the three frameworks we discussed in the class, including Propp's fairy tale functions.

After the break (where Wannes and I showed our identical pig socks to Zhitong), we resumed for the group projects session. Again, expectations were outlines, the groups were formed. I felt nervous about who my team members were going to be. Thankfully, I have a really nice group. Looking forward!

I felt fairly exhausted, came back home and finished _The Accidental Tourist_. Sad that the book ended. Very anti-climatic. Here is a quick review I wrote before I went to bed:

I started the day by discovering some Apple features. I also had the mental health team's call to understand more about my OCD. It was a super super helpful call. Melissa really understood what I was going through it felt like. She listened and asked questions. Having spoken to her, I feel more confident about the support I can get from Imperial and the healthcare system in the UK overall. And talking to Karin about it has helped as well. She is going through a similar process.

I spent the evening at exploring The British Library (although it did have a 40 minute queue to get a reading pass). I went to the humanities section to work. I forget what I did while I was there, but it must have been course work. I spent an hour more at the cafe after getting a hot chocolate. It felt slightly unreal that I was working from The British Library.

I spent the morning figuring out to health and deciding whether to switch GPs, as registering with Imperial College Healthcare centre would mean more robust access to mental health facilities. But, giving up a healthcare centre few hundred metres away was also not logical. I got some work done in the morning as I waiting for an assessment call from my current GP. Again, it was useful saying out loud what I have been going through for a while now.

Later in the morning, I left to meet my group project team at Wellcome. It went mostly alright, slightly awkward at first, since the majority of the team seems introverted. But, I think we have really talented people; it's all about finding an idea which allows all of us to play by our strengths. We spent an hour after our meeting exploring some of the galleries, including the one on sign language.

I spent some time in the reading room, mostly doing the mental health stuff and writing to people. I came back home to chat with Peter and submit the abstract to Play The Planet. Dinner and sleep.

I have picked up a new book: Self Defence by Prof. Daniel M. Davis. Interesting read so far on some of the common myths about immmune system. I primarily picked up the book because I know the author. His book, The Beautiful Cure, was one of the first science books I ever read. And, now I figured out that he is a professor at Imperial! I might be able to attend his talk later this month!

Left to The Wellcome Library; did some readings and wrote to people. I came back home for yet another relaxed dinner and slept.
