Past 15 days of Organisational Dynamics has been a mush. It feels like it has been forever since the course started. I am constantly startled by the fact that it has only been running for the past 15 days.

Almost every day has started at 0900 and ended at 1900. In the basic organisational dynamics week, we had sessions with the course instructor, reading session and co-education sessions. The advanced is a lot more packed with the mornings spent on a simulation exercise followed by reading and co-education.

Some days have been great, others have been tough.

One of the highlights have been talking to Prof. Vijayraghavan and Prof. Usha Raman about my career.
