In July 2022, all my undergrad classmates were hustling to figure out Masters, jobs, etc.  On the other hand, I boldly decided to take a year off. No plans. A year for myself.

Thus the adventurous journey began, journey that took me to 5 big cities, and taught me life and career lessons. I am documenting experiences here for the future me to look back on.
