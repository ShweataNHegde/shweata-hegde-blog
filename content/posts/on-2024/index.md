2024---the year full of turbulence. After crusing through 2022 and 2023, 2024 felt like a reality check. When I look back on the year, I only see disappointments, rejections, fights, poor health and lost confidence. However, all of the experiences have also taught me life lessons. Hopefully, as a result, I find myself more resilient in the years to come.

I spent the first half of the year doing applications, getting rejections and some acceptances. It was stressful to balance work at TIGS and write compelling applications. I also fell sick in March and I never felt healthy since then. After many deliberations I decided to the Young India Fellowship starting in August. I was really unsure if it was going to be useful and whether I would be able to manage the workload.

Life has become more complex it seems like. With parents falling sick more frequently, dealing with own anxiety and poor health, coupled with lack of recognition for my work and later being surrounded by a lot of talented people---I felt demotivated. I have perhaps shed more tears this year than my entire adult life.

My relationships also went through rough patches. K. and I have had so many arguments, and I am not proud of it. I have said things I wish I had not. I am mad at myself that I became a person I repelled for so long---self-centred and narrow-minded. However, as the YIF has progressed, I have slowly opened up. Hopefully I will regain my sense of self soon.
