2024---the year full of turbulence. After crusing through 2022 and 2023, 2024 felt like a reality check. When I look back on the year, I only see disappointments, rejections, fights, poor health and lost confidence. However, all of the experiences have also taught me life lessons. Hopefully, as a result, I find myself more resilient in the years to come.

I spent the first half of the year doing applications, getting rejections and some acceptances. It was stressful to balance work at TIGS and write compelling applications. TIGS sadly never was a fertile ground for my ideas to grow. I felt undervalued and I couldn't deliver my best either. The experience overall made me doubt whether I would make a good science communicator. I also fell sick in March and I never felt healthy since then. After many deliberations I decided to the Young India Fellowship. I was unsure if it was going to be useful and whether I would be able to manage the workload. Giving up my dream of doing a Masters abroad was hard, too.

I started the YIF August. It has worked out well so far. I have a set of friends, there is rhythm in routine, I am learning a lot and am meeting people. Of course, there are cons. I am stuck on campus most of the time. My anxiety goes out of the roof sometimes. The weather is horrible.

Whether I like to admit or not, LLMs take-over has been a demotivator. I have inhibitions to using LLMs for my day-to-day activities because of ethical reasons. However, I also see that people around me are getting work done a lot sooner by adopting the latest technology. Is there any point in honing my writing and coding?

Life has become more complex it seems like. With parents falling sick more frequently, dealing with own anxiety and poor health, coupled with lack of recognition for my work, and AI taking over---the year was tough to navigate. I have perhaps shed more tears this year than my entire adult life. My relationships also went through rough patches. K. and I have had so many arguments, and I am not proud of it. I have said things I wish I had not. I am mad at myself for becoming the person I tried repelling for so long---self-centred and narrow-minded. However, as the YIF has progressed, I have slowly opened up. Hopefully I will regain my sense of self soon.
