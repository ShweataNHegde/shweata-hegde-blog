The Young India Fellowship officially started this week. But I'm still at home. I have been sick for the past, I don't know how long (5 weeks?). I feel miserable sitting at home watching the WhatsApp group buzz.

The experience of falling sick, pushing travels, and missing out on Orientation has taught me life lessons. My current lifestyle is not sustainable. No physical exercise, insufficient food intake, obsessive hygiene practices, overthinking. Health is wealth. You can't dream big or make the world a better place without taking care of yourself first.
