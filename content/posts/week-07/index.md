Time is flying! New term from this week. We have two interesting courses, Art Appreciation (by Prof. Anunaya Chaubey) and Shakespeare and the World (Prof. Jonathan Gil Harris and Prof. Madhavi Menon).

## 2024-09-09
I had an uncomfortable experience during the first Art Appreciation class. Prof. asked to paint a canvas in an hour, give it a title, make note of challenges and display. I made an embarassingly bad painting. I was almost in tears after looking around and seeing amazing art works. I felt even worse because of how I reacted. I wish I was slightly better at dealing with being sucky at something.

On the other hand, the Shakespeare lecture was fun. It felt like I was watching a Netflix comedy show. The Prof. is very engaging and theatrical. We spent the first hour discussing the relevance of the course by debunking myth that Shakespeare is English and elite. One common obstacle we face with Shakespeare is his language. We looked at why that's the case, and how one can overcome it.

And, later in the evening, we had an open mic! I finally, after waiting for more than a year, got to perform :) I did a cover version of Love Me Like You Do, by Ellie Goulding. I was very nervous in the beginning, but I felt it leaving me towards the end of my first performance (thanks to the amazing YIF crowd). I had this familiar urge of wanting to perform again. Luckily, a batchmate of mine, had got a guitar and we ended up performing impromptu. A fun night performing and watching other people perfrom as well :)

I woke up tired and hungry. But no choice. Had to get ready because for the 0930 Art Appreciation lecture. In the lecture, we discussed what art is, how we make sense of visual world, and so on. We also explored topics like scopic regime, gestalt. Towards the end of the lecture, we looked at some art work to understand what beauty and aesthetics really mean. In the evening, we had a Discussion Session, where we made sense of each others' paintings. It was interesting how none of the people in my group thought it was a 'bad' painting.

Spent the rest of the day on the ISF proposal.

Again, woke up tired and hungry. No choice. Art Appreciation lecture. We looked at does one make sense of art. Based on discussions from past two days, we arrived at: 

"Artwork embodies an Intention, which is experienced by Beholder, who uses sensations, knowledge and emotion to generate an artistic experience."

We looked at some case studies: Wind of Sea, Madhubani paintings and Yayomi Kasama's work.
