## 2025-03-03 to 2025-03-09

Term 06 has begun. We have "Deconstructing Indian Foreign Policy" and "The Welfare State". These courses are very outside of my comfort zone. However, I have not been able to give these courses the time they deserve because of climate and WSCI presentations. I was disappointed by the fact that I did not get to present my climate group assignment; the professor cut me off because we were running late for dinner. Similarly, our WSCI project was also controversial in some sense, but I personally did not receive feedback.

On the other side, I amped up preparing for Chevening. I met an alum from ICL and got in touch with Peter. However, managing preparation with the new term and assignments was tough.

Finally, Sunday evening was nice in that I got to watch the final Cricket Championship match outside the Mess. It was a fun group watching, cheering, screaming, and witnessing a win. India won, yes.

That brings us to today.

Monday was supposed to be a regular YIF day. We had an early morning class (0900 is early), Office Hours, and another class. However, one of the Office Hours with Prof. Krishnamurthy left me very unsettled. She brough up how my label of science communication constrains my ability to truly learn, and how, for a communicator, it is important to know how to learn. She also said that, in order for me to be a confident communicator, I need to have learnt a lot. Usually, the first Office Hours are meant for us to get to know each other, and this coming out of nowhere took me aback. Ofcourse, I agree to most of what she said. I really haven't had the chance to reflect on how I have been learning at the YIF and whether it has been of any meaning. But then, we are just so packed that I barely get the time to synthesise.

The Office Hours was proceeded by Prof. Krishnamurthy's class, I managed to listen to the lecture, but most of it went over my head.

Over breakfast made the decision to attend the Discussion Session hosted by Foreign Policy TA. It was one of the best DS sessions since the Statistics time. Palak was wonderful. She explained how perspective is key to International Relations. She discussed why World Wars have been the basis of foreign policy and described how NATO and Warsaw Pact were formed. I'm so grateful that she went over the basics.

Critical Writing class was kind of fun, too. We had a peer review exercise, where we went over each other's writings about English curriculum development.

Finally, I focused the rest of the day on Chevening. I spoke to Nehal, clarified about some of the interview questions and had a mock with Peter. They were both useful in helping me realise that I need to prepare A LOT. A LOT. I am starting to get anxious about the interview. But I need to keep at it. I have also reached out to two scholars. Fingers crossed.
