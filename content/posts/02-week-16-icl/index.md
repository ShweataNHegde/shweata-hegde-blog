WHAT A WEEK! I felt like I was finally back in form work-wise after a long lull.

## Monday

I started Monday with a useful class on evidence-based policy making. I, then, ran to meet Peter and his family (including his granddaughter _Wolf Maiden_). In between, I also managed to find time to write both him and the grandkids a postcard; felt nice to be back in writing form.

We met at the Science Museum first, it was nice to be around energetic kids and their parents. Peter and I left to Dyson cafe for my usual vegetable biriyani lunch. Peter asked some tough questions about my vision for future for which I found myself saying that I wanted to set up a science media house in India. That seems bold at the moment. Or, I could potentially work with Imperial Global and Science Gallery Bengaluru. We later discussed quite philosophically about the importance of the Open, applied the multiple streams approach to life, where the confluence of multiple factors leads to development of something worthwhile. I took him on a quick tour of Imperial. Finally, we then sat in the scicomm break-out area for a while. He continued his usual advice. Towards the end, he asked for updates on Bradley-Mason award I was supposed to rewamp. I was guilty for not having made any progress. In fact, I was even frustrated by the mixed messaging by Peter and Henry. But, Peter said something that changed everything. He told I wasn't appointed as a manager to run the event. Instead, I was being given a pot of money to make a splash in the spirit of Bradley and Mason. I was meant to take full control.

I let the thoughts brew, and went back home with Marina to do my readings. I took the overground for the first time that day and got to see Batersea Powerstation and River Thames both times.

## Tuesday

I started my day by getting over an anxiety to message in Whatsapp groups, promoting science communication. A while back, at a pub, I had met a science communicator from University of Westminister, who had asked me to spread a word about FameLab. I procrasinated for a long time becuase of my fear of messaging. I got over it that day; messaged couple of Chevening and Imperial groups.

Post lunch, Wannes, Rosanne and I met Stephen to discuss the details about volunteering for Good Science Project. Stephen's project kind of inspired me to apply for this Master's; I am therefore keen on working with him. As a first task, I am 'scribbing' for the Friday Forum event.

Narrative class was alright; we discussed narrative voices, and relationship between author, narrator, and characters.

But, the most exciting part of the day was waiting. Tuesday seminar! While most speakers in the last term were recent graduates, this term's opening speaker was different. Flora Graham, the editor-in-chief of Nature Briefing. She has been in my inbox for the past 6 years! I fangirled through her presentation. She is wonderful. Her presentation was interesting and chat in the bar even more so. We spoke politics, process of writing newsletter, etc. I also wrote her a note on a penguin card and gifted her a penguin as a souvenier :) (The newsletter has a long-standing series of penguin hunting).

I must have slept well that night.

## Wednesday
I woke up feeling very high over the previous day. Since I could not focus on studying, I spent time chatting with Wannes about stochasticity. Out of nowhere, Wannes mentioned if he wanted to be a co-president with him on the science communication society. I had spoken about it earlier, so I was already ready. We immediately started drafting the application to Imperial Student Union. Wannes is incredibly efficient, my goodness! We had a rough draft ready in a few hours. And in those few hours, a lot of other ideas neatly fell into place. My ideas on centralising a lot of activies around science communication could be done through the Society, I realised. More imporantly, we also can do something with Peter and Henry on open science and use their money! It was almost like an epiphany, where two forces came together. Or like Kingdon's multiple streams approach, where forces saw a confluence.

After being very pleased with our progress, I left to meet Ingrid, a Chevening scholar and alum from my course. We got hot chocolate from San Marino and had a wonderful time chatting about the course, the society idea and science communication about sustainability.

I, then, left to Imperial for my Impressionism class. The class was mindblowing as I learnt the history of the movement, looked at some prominent painters from the school, and related the movement to photography, modernity and scientific progress. I also had a lovely conversation with one of the students about science communication; she was a neuroscience graduate from Cambridge. Dan is absolutely pleased that I am doing the Impressionist course, he has so many recommendations for galleries to visit!

However, the day was not all glorious. First thing in the morning, I also had a call with nurse. I had an ununsual light bleeding through the whole week; I do not know what it means. I am worried...

## Thursday

I made a quick turn of changes to my schedule to meet Henry at White City since he was unavailable in the afternoon. I finally had made enough progress through the Society application to actually talk to him! Henry and I had a productive conversation. He said yes to supporting the Society! I am excited. I stayed back in White City. The campus there is lot calmer and the cafe was cute. I messaged Ashutosh, one of the Chevening scholars, asking if he was avaialble for a chat.

He did not message back to me until I had finished my lunch. But, I am glad I stayed longer. We hit off immediately. We spoke about science policy, his grassroots 'ethnocentric' policy work, etc. But then, we started talking about mental health. I realised that we were incredibly similar! It really is so nice to speak to someone who actually understands you. It's like a small carved den for yourself, shielded from world's judgements. We spoke. We spoke. We left to his home. We spoke. We spoke. About his work, my interests and frustrations, and everything in between. As I told him later, it was one of those days, where I could have talked forever.

I came back home to do some reading, before calling it a day.

## Friday
I woke up late, barely making it on time to the group project meeting at Imperial. The meeting was a bit awkward in the beginning with people taking time to open up, but the brainstorming session went well. We generated quite a few ideas, but eventually settled on Kuhn. Super excited for the project!

After lunch, I left for my vaccine appointment. I was nervous, but there was no looking back. I embraced walking in the sun and made it to the health care well in time. The nurse was incredibly kind and put me in ease. The vaccines hurt quite a bit, not going to lie.

I came back to Imperial, worked on the grouped project proposal before attending the online Science Communication Open Day.

After a dose of hot chocolate and reading, I left to home to rest. I surprisingly felt alright the whole night.
