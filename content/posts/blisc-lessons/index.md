Today's weather was weird. The sun was not fully out in the morning. It suddenly rained in the afternoon. Later, the sun shone bright for a while before the pouring rain hit the ground. 

I took this picture late afternoon before the second rain. Funnily, I had never fully explored this part of the Old NCBS building. They have nice outdoor spaces! 

As I took the picture, I realised how my time here at the BLiSc campus resembles today's weather. I had a gloomy start, things went downhill, but I pulled myself back up for some sunshine moments, and now it's back to being gloomy again. It's been a wild three months. Living alone, exploring by myself, making and losing acquaintances, pulling together an international trip from scratch, running the podcast, navigating new workspace and tasks, and doing applications. No wonder I feel overwhelmed. But like there is beauty in these rain-soaked flowers facing the somewhat blue sky, there is one in my struggles and successes, too. I'll have to keep chugging along. I'm grateful to this place for its lessons.
