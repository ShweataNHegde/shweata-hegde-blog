Last week of the term! I cannot believe we are almost halfway through the Fellowship :)

The week was busy.

The week started with preparing dance numbers for last critical writing class and meeting Manu Prakash, the curious scientist. The subsequent day, after his talk, I met him again at 0700 in the morning. Being around him was such a delight to say the least. With me were Makerspace folks and two students from his frugal science course. They steered the conversation around open hardware. I could not contribute much. But I was internally relating them to open source ideas Peter keeps bringing up. We also went on a quick expedition to the nearby village---Asawapur. Again, I was mesmorised by how he saw the world and spoke to people. Somehow, he knew how to listen, ask questions and get information. For example, he befriended a volunteer next to a government school. The volunteer ended up giving a tour, telling us his life story and reading Rig Veda. Before he left, he handed all of us a Foldscope.

The final classes of Economics and The New Geography of Information Age felt anti-climatic. I am, however, going to miss both the professors.

Later in the week, we presented the board game version of our game, Pralay. Preparing for it took a lot of our time, we spent an hour or so everyday leading up it. Thankfully, the hardwork paid off. The demo went well and we got positive feedback.

Finally, I spent the weekend coding with Prawin. We are trying to understand discourse around vaccine in YouTube comments. Getting YouTube API and a Large Language Model working to get comments and do a sentiment analysis has been quite the task, but we have made some progress.

P.S. I am on my way to the Science Journalism Association of India's Annual conference happening in Pune. Writing the journal account from the sky. As I pass by lighted cities I see from above, I am filled with gratitude. The year has been tough, but I am finally back to travelling. Pune is going to be the first new city I will be visiting in 2024. Glad that the conference is a break from smog-filled chilly Sonipat.
