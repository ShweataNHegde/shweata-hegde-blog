The ritual of talking to parents has been part of my daily routine since I moved out of home for my undergraduate studies. It is usually a less than 5-minute phone call where mum or dad checks in to ask how I am doing and mostly give advice.

An outsider might think that my parents and I are extremely close given our daily conversations, yet that is far from reality. On most days, I get asked the same functional questions: whether I attended classes or went for work, whether I ate food, if I needed money. Most calls end with an advice to not go out, not to talk to too many people, not to trust people, not to work too much, etc. Yes, most of it is mostly restrictions: things not to do. Obviously, as a young adult in the 21st century world, I, at some point, have stopped listening to these nots. This means I do what my parents mostly will not approve of (nothing illegal, of course). Therefore, most of our conversations will never be about my day, all the adventures or challenges. It is always answering their functional questions.

The topics of conversations have changed since I moved to London. Now, particularly dad, is more curious. He asks me, “What’s the weather?”, “How does the water not freeze in pipes?”, “How do you commute?”, “Do you wash your own dishes?”, “What kind of food do you get?”. Yet, these are still functional questions. Not one day has he asked about the places I went out to, friends I made, etc. In one sense, they are aware of the nitty-gritties of the mundane, but, they barely know the colourful life of mine. I cannot tell them I was out till 2100 visiting a gallery. Neither can I talk to them about being out in the pub sipping on alcohol for the first time.

Sometimes, I am very annoyed by this predicament. I am for the most part constrained from asking any real advice (this would mean revealing what I am up to). Additionally, all I hear from them these days are news stories: there was a fire incident in Swiss (be careful), there was an attack on a train (be careful).

However, funnily, these days, I am starting to find this ritual almost meditative. Patiently answering the same questions (with mostly same answers) day after day. I am starting to realise that the conversation is really to remind each other that we exist, and that we are okay (although I sometimes have to say I am okay even if I am out).
