The ritual of talking to parents has been part of my daily routine since I moved out of home for my undergraduate studies in 2019. It is usually a less than 5-minute phone call where mum or dad checks in to ask how I am doing and mostly give advice.

An outsider might assume that my parents and I are extremely close given our daily conversations, yet that is far from reality. On most days, I get asked the same functional questions: whether I attended classes or went for work, whether I ate food, if I needed money. The topics of conversations have changed since I moved to London. Now, particularly dad, is more curious. He asks me, “What’s the weather?”, “How does the water not freeze in pipes?”, “How does commute work?”, “Do you wash your own dishes?”, “What kind of food do you get?”, "how are your professors like?", "is your course any good?" etc. So, there is a bit more variety.

However, even now (after me turning 24), most calls end with an advice to not go out, not to talk to too many people, not to trust people, not to work too much, etc. Most of it is mostly restrictions: things not to do. Obviously, as a young adult in the 21st century world, I, at some point, have stopped listening to these not-to-dos. Which also means over time, I have had to be careful about what I share with them. 

In one sense, they are aware of the nitty-gritties of the mundane, but, they barely know the colourful life of mine. Not one day have they asked about the places I went out to, friends I made, etc. I cannot tell them I was out till 2100 visiting a gallery. Neither can I talk to them about being out in the pub with friends. Or that I felt extremely proud of myself for braving the Christmas market crowd one evening to enjoy the festive vibes. Sometimes, I feel annoyed by this predicament. Not only do they have a false conception of who I am, but they have also cut themself of from being able to give any real advice beyond their usual not-to-dos. These days they have also become bearers of bad news: there was a fire incident in Swiss (be careful), there was an attack on a train (be careful). Their obsession to keep me safe, what can I say.

If at all, I attempt to add any positive spin to this ritual, it feels like an exercise of meditation and repetition. Patiently answering the same questions (with mostly same answers) day after day. The repetition to remind ourselves of our existence in each other's lives.

I wish things were simpler and had normal parents. Oh, well.
