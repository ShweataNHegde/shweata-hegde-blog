# Our Emotions Around Languages
After living in Mysore (a quiet city in Karnataka) for most of my life, I moved to Bengaluru last year for work. Naturally, I bumped into more non-kannada-speaking folks than usual, and English became my go-to language. Nothing to fret about. All my life I’ve enjoyed speaking in English. I took pride in being fluent in the language at school and even college. I often said I think in English. I had no issues giving presentations, making points in meetings, or having casual conversations at the workplace.

But after a while, I noticed something. When it came to emotions or describing an incident that moved me, English failed. I found myself reaching out to a specific Kannada word, only to not find an English equivalent. I missed speaking in Kannada. Maybe my brain was not thinking in English after all? It seemed like certain Kannada words and emotions were closely tied and imprinted, which English words could never replace.

Interestingly, I knew only two languages until I went to college (Kannada and English). From friends and roommates, I picked up Tamil. And, somehow, because it was friends from whom I learnt Tamil, the language always offers comfort, warmth and fun whenever I speak it.

Two Young India Fellows also offered perspectives, which supplemented my experiences. Unlike my urge to switch to Kannada in certain personal settings, Arushi, who is from Jodhpur, said she has no difficulty expressing herself in Hindi (home language) or English. On the other hand, Sohan, a Bengali who has lived in Gurgaon all his life, shared a feeling similar to my own for Tamil. He remarked, “Hindi is a “Mazedhar” language; a language he loves speaking with friends”.

In conclusion, emotions around language seem to be guided by various factors. First, the social and cultural environment in which it was learnt from and spoken. Tamil (for me) and Hindi (for Sohan) are fun because we talk to friends in them. Second, the richness of our vocabulary and tight connection between specific words and emotions. I take pride in my English in an academic context, but when explaining emotions I prefer more precise words in Kannada.
