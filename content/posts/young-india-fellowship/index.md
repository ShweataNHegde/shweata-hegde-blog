Yay! I got selected for the [Young India Fellowship (YIF)](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/academic-programme/young-india-fellowship/) 2025. Taking a gap year after undergrad was risky, but I'm happy that it led me to the YIF. In a month's time, I will be back to being a student. Probably for the first time, my education will be worthy of time and investment. What sold YIF for me is an that it's all-in-one package. I'm learning history, economics, statistics, astrophysics, climate, leadership, writing, and many other disciplines and skills. And my peers are fully committed to the Fellowship, it seemed like! During my undergrad, none of us really wanted to learn from our classes. We didn't engage in critical discussions or bother putting any efforts into assignments.

## Why am I doing YIF?

Currently in life, I'm lost. Having run IndiaAsksWhy and #semanticClimate with some success, I know it is to sustain projects and make a living out of them. How to get to a stage where I get to make an impact, but I want to get paid decently.

And then, a lot happened over the gap year,
-  I grew as a person. I was a free-bird when I graduated undergrad, but now I know I have responsibilities of myself and family. 
- I didn't strike the balance between work and life (hence dealing with sickness now). 
- Flooed by failures and rejections, I lost confidence in myself towards the end of the gap year.

I'm not hoping for a magic solution from the YIF. But maybe I can connect with people with similar struggles and learn? Figure out what jobs fit me?

## Advice for Myself
These may sound generic, but to keep reminding myself, some advice:
- Be open to new people, ideas, and experiences
- Enjoy the fellowship; be a part of the community
- Learn, learn, learn
- Speak up
- Make mistakes
- Take care of physical and mental health; eat enough food

Good luck to myself and all my peers from 2025 batch. Let's see if the YIF lives upto its hype.
