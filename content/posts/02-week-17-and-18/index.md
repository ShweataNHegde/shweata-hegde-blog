Ah, past two weeks have been challenging to say the least. Week 17, I was sick with cold (thankfully, it did not turn into something worse). Week 18, I was officially diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and am having to navigate being a disordered woman, fun.

# Week 17
## Monday
The science policy class on NICE was interesting. After switching to iPad as my primary work device, I have become more systematic in taking notes (I use OneNote). Your ability to grasp concepts becomes easier if you take thorough notes of readings I realised. I also had a quick meeting for the group project that day.

Wannes and I spontaneously decided to attend a talk on sub-state diplomacy at Goodenough; we used the commute to discuss Science Communication Society stuff. The bus was a bit odd for me to concentrate or even treat it as a meeting. The event at Goodenough was interesting; there were two speakers, one from Flanders and other from Catalonia. Them talking about their region reminded me of discourses states in India have about their identity and positioning. I also met some of Wannes's scholarship friends.

## Tuesday
I woke up feeling very sick. Left for classes, still. The dissertation session was useful; the narrative class was alright. The seminar speaker was extremely interesting: Charlie from Nice and Serious spoke how to actually take climate change information to people where they are.

I was feeling feverish and head-achey but convinced myself to attend the pottery workshop I had already spent my money on. I was thankfully joined by my classmates; it turned out to be a fun social bonding experience. We painted two coasters together. I am less afraid of art after art appreciation class from last year.

## Wednesday
I spent the morning at home before heading to Uni to meet Sabir for lunch. Conversations with him is always nice; I get to learn politics and refine my ideas about how to bring about meaningful change in society through science communication.

The impressionism class was interesting; however, mainly looked at the influences of the time that led for impressionism movement to develop (The Flanuer in the middle class French, influence of photography, representation of different classes, etc). I should definitely go to National Gallery Room 41 again to check out Manet and others.

I sat upstairs in the Student Activity and Learning Centre blogging. It felt good to recall and summarise a wonderful week (Week 16).

## Thursday
I stayed back at home doing readings, working, etc. The Science Communication Society work took a slight backseat as the initial excitement sort of waned out. I had a call with Mimmi, the public engagement officer at Imperial for upcoming Lates and attended Democratisation of Science workshop online where I met Siddharth. The workshop was odd; with social sciences and humanities, there are so many troops with different ways of thinking about problems and framing them. If you are not careful, you will end up with a troop with whom you would have very little common ground despite having similar interests. I felt I was with the wrong troop with this workshop.

In the evening, I co-worked with Marina. My anxiety went up because I could not use the extremely smelly loo in the library; all I wanted to do was wash hands. This is why I prefer Wellcome; well-kept and decent crowd. Marina is fun to hang out with though.

## Friday
I rushed to make it in time for our usual Friday group project. The meeting was productive. We decided on the topic (will not reveal because our team wants it a secret). I took up researching, excited but also nervous if I have enough time.

Next, I headed to Alexander Flemming, where I was 'scribing' for The Friday Forum event on security science. I knew little about the conversations around security science, but was interested in learning more. Wannes and Rosanne had already set up the camera. It was a bit awkward for me to go around and ask questions to people; I did it anyway.  The session itself was alright; if I were to be honest, did not address the ethics of doing security science at all. It took a very different direction of justifying institutional involvement. Some of my classmates were rightfully furious.

I worked for some time, met Muminah at the Library Cafe. She is such a thoughtful and talented person; I wish I interacted with her a lot more. After speaking to her, I worked for a bit more, made a to-do list and headed home.

## Saturday
I was at home till afternoon doing readings and working on Pralay. In the evening, I went out for a movie with the same set of friends I did pottery workshop with. The whole experience had me teary from the beginning. With this being the first movie with friends in London (getting over the fear), I was reminded of my Interstellar movie trip with Arushi and YIFs, and Barbie movie trip in Mysore with my gals. The movie itself, Hamnet, was quite emotional. Too emotional, I would argue. I came back home, read for a bit and slept.

## Sunday
I went to Wellcome post lunch, finished most of my Policy readings (I was pleased with my progress and got myself Hot Chocolate). Precautionary principle is definitely intersting! I managed to squeeze in a trip to Canary Wharf to see the winter lights. I deliberately took a route that would put me on the Elizabeth line. It was my first time taking this line, it is so good and purple! Canary Wharf was a bit hard to navigate on my own. Too many people and the installations were spread across. I was also too taken aback by all the tall sky scrapers. The installations were nice, a tad bit underwhelming in person. I struggled very hard to get to the installation I had been looking forward to the most. It was a light show suspended above a lake opposite a tube line. I had given up and was making my way to Jubliee line tube station and it turned out that the installation was right across the station! I spent some time absorbing the experience before heading home.

I spent considerable amount of time talking with Karin about my mental health assessment and making notes for myself. Slept late as a consequence.

# Week 18
## Monday
Began my day very early to make it in time for my mental health assessment at 0900. The assessment did not take long, nor was it emotionally taxing. I mean, by this point, I have already spoken to 2-3 counsellors. The questions weren't all that different. But, what was different this time was that my counsellor gave me an actual diagnosis. I have OCD. She said they would start with therapy soon.

I rushed to class immediately after. I could barely focus, but it was alright. I had done the readings well. After lunch with friends, I left to go to Dana Library at Science Museum. It is a nice, quiet space. I read for Narrative. I also had a lovely chat with the librarians; it turns out that you can get a library card as a postgraduate student from Imperial! I borrowed Kuhn's book and left to the Library Cafe.

I thought I had time to visit Senate Library as well, but chose not to, because I was also doing Royal Society later in the evening. I worked from the Cafe for a bit, before taking the bus to The Royal Society.

The bus ride took half an hour longer because of diversions, but I made it to the talk just in time. The lecture was amazing. Professor Mike, who was being given the Leeuwenhoek Award, spoke about his work on drug discovery and diagnosis for neglected infectious diseases. He was a really good communicator and covered grounds from discovery science to translational research to equity in public health. The highlight of the day was spotting Prof. Jitu Mayor (used to be the director of NCBS) during the talk and meeting him after. He now is at Warwick and said would be happy to host me! It's wild that I got to meet someone whom I would never have approached if I were back home in India.

After a long but significant day, I decided to treat myself with some chocolates...

## Tuesday
I met Rosanne in the morning for the security science video editing. Although we fumbled around in the beginning, we managed to make decent progress. Post lunch, I attended Narrative class. I struggled to speak in my group with anxiety flaring up. Managed okay. After attending Kelly's session, I met Felicity to chat about my diagnosis. She was incredibly kind and supportive. Grateful to have such professors. I also spoke to her about the Society. I came back home and rested.

## Wednesday
I stayed at home figuring out health and booked blood tests. I left for Impressionism class, was late by 10 minutes. This week, we looked at female nudes and how impressionism directly challenged the traditional nudes by representing real people and prostitutes in their art. I worked for quite some time at the library; briefly met Ashutosh.

## Thursday
Imperial Lates day!

I worked on Narrative script in the morning and left for Uni in the afternoon. Good Biryani at Dyson Cafe, followed by meeting with Siobhan. The blood test appointment was quick. I was back at Uni in no time. I got some brownie and hot chocolate. I felt very nervous preparing the script to introduce Dan Davies at Imperial Lates. More so because I had known Dan Davies's work since 2020 and felt like I hadn't done enough to show how much I love his work. At 1700, I made my way to the venue. I was there a bit too early, I sat in the lecture hall, rewriting the script. One of the team members arrived a little later, I spoke to her about public engagement and community engagement work at Imperial. You get to learn so much from these interactions.

Dan arrived with his wife shortly after. I was struck by how jovial and easy going he was as a person! We quickly set up his presentation, and I started chatting with his wife who was absolutely lovely. People started trickling in and soon the lecture hall was full. I felt jittery having to introduce him, but I was glad I had a script to follow. Facing the crowd/public was a fear I am glad I overcame in that moment. Dan's talk was brilliant. I felt very awkward doing the Q&A, but I don't think people noticed that much. Just like that, the first session was over.

Luckily for me, there were two more sessions just like this one. First, I was resenting having to face the crowd over and over again, but soon, I realised it was my best opportunity to learn. This time, I tried a slightly more natural version of the introduction and I was a lot more calmer during the Q&A. The third one was best! I cracked two jokes: one on how I can give the talk myself and two about having to choose a question being stressful. The day ended with some free pizza and good conversations! I am so glad I signed to be a volunteer :)

I came back home and curated some of my research for the group project meeting.

## Friday
Early morning meeting with the group; was very productive. I am so glad we all are proactive with our work. I then ran to help Stephen set up the classroom for Writing Science workshop. It was fun working with him :) Met some interesting people; and got some insiders perspective on running such events.

It took a while to calm myself and transition to doing other work. After writing some emails, I left to Library Cafe for a meal. I did some admin tasks on the side, wrote to people. I also am developing my dissertation proposal, and it is going alright. Talking to people has really really helped. I will write a separate post outlining ideas, but most think I am on the right track.

I, then, left to attend Friday Lates at Science Gallery London. I took the tube in the wrong direction, it has only ever happened once before. Anwyay, we made it to the venue just in time, despite the wandering. Either it was my exhaustion or being in a crowded space, or the topic, I wasn't feeling it. I walked around, briefly checked out the exhibits, attended the sci-fi talk and screening, and left for home early.

And also, over the week, I have had elaborate conversations with this Instagram creator: Kutuhula. He has inspired me or at least made me think harder about how to reach the mass with science content online.
