As a family, we seldom went out to the town together; naturally, whenever we did, it was memorable. One such event was registering for our Aadhar cards. One day after school, my parents and I went to a registration center near the famous temple in the town. I had no idea what Aadhar was, and my parents did not explain it either. It was a small shop with benches, and it was unusually crowded. As a jumpy 10-year-old, I did not want to wait. Hours passed. When our turn finally came, I realized why the process took so long: the biometrics. People had to try multiple times before their biometrics were recorded. Of course, this was in the early days, somewhere around 2010, and the process, I am sure, is a lot smoother now.  

Years passed, and I slowly witnessed how the Aadhar card became a ubiquitous requisite, for schooling to traveling. By class 6 or 7, the school mandated a photocopy of Aadhar to be submitted. For entrance exams, Aadhar was the popular choice. Next, the college wanted one. When I went to the bank to create my account, I submitted a copy again. Finally, I produced my Aadhar to get all my other documents done—Passport, PAN card, and Driver’s License. I continue to use Aadhar to travel. This is the story of millions of us who grew up post-Aadhar.  

Aadhar has just always been there. It is hard to conceive a world without it. However, until recently, I had not critically thought about the role Aadhar plays in our lives. Reading a blog by Yale, I learned that thanks to Aadhar, “Banks and mobile phone companies have enrolled poor people who previously had been seen as too risky and cost-prohibitive to be viable customers.” It also prevented ration supplies from being diverted by the corrupt. On the other hand, Aadhar also opened up the issue of who owns biometric and private data. With all bank, school, and other related data linked to your Aadhar, it is not inconceivable to link the data with your behavior to surveil you. The Right to Privacy is now a Fundamental Right, but is it enough to stop the government and other stakeholders from harnessing your data? It is not clear.  

As the blog points out, a pushback against Aadhar also comes from those who were threatened by the fact that it might reveal their private economic activity. This was mainly felt by the rich or fraudsters, who could be looking to use “concern for the masses as a means to sabotage a program that they want to get rid of.”  

However, life without Aadhar is presently inconceivable. Although not mandatory on paper, availing many private and most government services requires you to have Aadhar. As discussed by Kiran Jonnalagadda in his article “Life Without Aadhar,” creating a bank account, filing tax returns, and buying property—all these activities are incredibly difficult to accomplish without possessing Aadhar. There have even been cases where medical care was denied in the absence of an Aadhar card.  

To conclude, I feel there needs to be more transparency from the government and UIDAI regarding what happens to the data. Alternatives to not having an Aadhar card should be spelled out more clearly when services are being availed. There also needs to be more awareness among the public, especially when there are people like me who sometimes accept impositions without question.
