## Introduction
“This is just a genuine plea. Please be just a little more conscious when it comes to segregating waste.” Plastic recycling messages, such as this one taken from an email, are everywhere—public messaging, institutional communication, and so on. Plastic recycling is widely accepted as a sustainable practice that reduces pollution and environmental harm. The foundational principles of waste management—reduce, reuse, recycle—have been in textbooks starting from primary school. However, these calls to “individual” action often rest on normative assumptions by various stakeholders. Consumers are one of the primary stakeholders in the discourse of plastic recycling, and the paper investigates some of these assumptions.

## Assumption 1: Plastics are inherently bad for the environment

Since its first synthesis in the early 20th century, plastic has become an integral part of modern life. According to the World Population Review, more than 8 billion tons of plastic have been produced since the 1950s. Recent research has established the serious consequences of plastic (and microplastics) on ecosystems, human health, and the climate. Therefore, plastic being bad is a true normative assumption, however, one must realise that the major problem lies in its mass production and disposal. Given these consequences, reducing plastic production and consumption should take precedence over post-consumer solutions like recycling. 

## Assumption 2: Recycling works and can offset the impacts of plastic consumption
When we segregate waste, we assume that most plastic gets recycled. Contrary to popular belief, recycling has not significantly mitigated the impact of plastic waste. Only 9% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled (World Population Review). The rest is either incinerated, landfilled, or enters ecosystems, including oceans and urban landfills like Bhalswa and Ghazipur in India, which we see on our commute to Delhi.

Several logistical and market challenges undermine the efficacy of recycling. Mixed plastics, contamination, and low market demand make many plastics economically unviable to recycle. Further, recent international regulations have restricted the export of plastic waste to developing countries like China, exacerbating the issue. These factors reveal that recycling is often more aspirational than operational.

## Assumption 03: Anything with a triangle symbol is recyclable
The triangle symbol seen on plastic items is called the Resin Identification Code (RIC), which has caused public confusion about its meaning. In the 1980s, the public became increasingly concerned about the environment due to monumental work by conservationists such as Rachel Carson (The History and Future of Plastics Adapted From: Https://Www.chemheritage.org/The-History-And-Future-of-Plastics What Are Plastics, and Where Do They Come From?). To trick the public, the Society of Plastics Industry (Read: the big companies) made the plastic’s RIC symbol look extremely similar to the Reduce, Reuse, Recycle logo, thereby successfully convincing people that plastic is recyclable and therefore consumable. In reality, as climate science communicator Rollie Willimans states, “recycling is a lie to sell more plastic” (Climate Town). This corporate strategy avoided accountability for the lifecycle of their products.

## Conclusion
In this cycle of misinformation and misplaced optimism, the burden of responsibility is unfairly shifted to consumers and waste workers. The people managing the End-of-Life (EOL) phase of plastic often face the brunt of mis-segregated waste and non-recyclable materials. Furthermore, expecting public compliance without reforming production practices or regulation only reinforces systemic inefficiencies.

By examining the historical, economic, and logistical realities of plastic waste management, we see that while recycling may be a well-intentioned strategy, it often functions as a symbolic and almost tokenistic act that ping-pongs responsibility from producers to consumers, rather than addressing the root problem of overproduction and overconsumption. As  Williams and Buitrago put it, “…from a manufacturer's viewpoint is geared to individuals who dispose of litter, such as bottles, cigarettes, etc. and are deemed as being responsible for the litter; vice versa for the public who place the blame on the manufacturers ”. A more effective solution lies in rethinking production, enforcing regulations, and fostering consumer awareness that goes beyond symbolic gestures.
