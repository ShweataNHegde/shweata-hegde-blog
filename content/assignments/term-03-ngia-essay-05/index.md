As someone who studied biology during undergrad, I was surprised to have not heard about the Split Brain Experiment (which probably shows my slight disinterest in neuroscience). Prof. Debayan’s descriptions of patients behaving oddly after their callosotomy—a procedure disconnecting the two halves of the brain—made me probe further.

Searching YouTube landed me on the most [popular video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfYbgdo8e-8) on this topic by the CGP Grey channel. It described the experiments conducted in the late 19th century on split-brain patients by Sperry et al., which revealed the different specializations of the left and right hemispheres of the brain, a phenomenon known as lateralization. However, I found certain phrasings in the video questionable. Specifically, it claimed that “you are two,” meaning that there are two separate minds in an individual—the linguistic “left brain” and visual-processing “right brain.” It speculates that, in non-split-brain individuals, the “right brain rose up as a companion without a choice.” The video ends with a deeply unsettling thought: “At this moment, in your normal head, there are two of you watching this video: one having a 'mind-blown' moment, and the other mentally rolling its eyes at the obviousness of it all.” I found this perspective—that there are two separate conscious agents—somewhat misinterpreting the experiments.

On probing further about split-brain experiments, I found a [video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOsCwRsLAR0) (about two hours long) by a science communication channel called The Art of Deduction, debunking CGP Grey’s video. This video essay brought out the nuances missed by CGP Grey. First, the need to use “hemispheres” instead of “brains” to refer to the two parts of the brain. Second, pointing out that a callosotomy does not mean that your brain is completely split in two, as this ignores other connections and parts of the brain. Third, showcasing that CGP Grey’s video is based on an early paper about a former army personnel, whose brain injury might have exaggerated the effects of the surgical procedure. Quoting a research study by Pinto et al., which said, “canonical textbook findings that a split-brain patient can only respond to stimuli in the left visual half-field with the left hand, and to stimuli in the right visual half-field with the right hand and verbally, are not universally true,” the video essay emphasized the differential response to the surgery by individuals. Pinto et al.’s paper indicates that “severing the cortical connections between hemispheres splits visual perception, but does not create two independent conscious perceivers within one brain.”

In conclusion, CGP Grey’s video was yet another example of oversimplification gone wrong.
This criticism of the implication of split-brain experiment results does not undermine the fact that split-brain experiments are fascinating to watch. For example, there are perplexing videos where these patients are able to draw two separate shapes simultaneously with their left and right hands. However, it is also important to note that many of these quirks seen in the patients cannot be generalized.
