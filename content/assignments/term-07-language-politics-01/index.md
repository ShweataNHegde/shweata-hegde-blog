Recently, I came across a series of Instagram Reels on a Bharatanatyam dancer’s offshoot account. In the series, she plays the character of a Kannadiga ajji, a grandmother, who teaches non-Kannadigas the usage of specific ‘colloquial’ Kannada words (Calling out my own language ideology—what constitutes colloquial as opposed to formal/standard? I do not have an answer).

In one such video (ruks_avatars)—which one could call a metapragmatic discourse—she first teaches the literal usage of chatri, a Kannada word that means umbrella. Secondly, she asks what the term “dummukuchatri” (transliterates to jumping umbrella) means. Dummukuchatri is a seldom used word, which means parachute; one could call this an attempt to prevent the erasure of certain infrequently used Kannada words. Finally, she describes chatri’s property to “keep turning, round, round, round” and iconises the word by saying “this is the same quality of a chatri person”, referring to people who cannot be trusted. Going further, the ajji character’s language and conversation with the audience is indexical of a ‘typical progressive nit-picky, complaining’ grandmother (this could very well be my own iconisation, too). She is well-versed in English and knows how to communicate and translate Kannada words. However, this typical representation can also be seen as an erasure of the existence of other ajjis.

On watching the video multiple times, I noticed the switch in her tonality when she transitions from English and Kannada and vice versa. She is pleasing and kind while talking in English, however, she becomes raw and almost rude when speaking in Kannada. Of course, these could also be my ideology of iconising language (and body language) and imposing value judgements of kind and raw. Interestingly, towards the end, there is also a tone switch to rude when she translates Kannada examples to English. This could be an instance of fractal recursivity in play, where the language tone opposition between Kannada and English is seen as oppositions within the explanation in English. Zooming out, this dichotomy in tonality is reactivated in the association—prevalent among Kannadigas—of English-speakers as kind and exploitable and Kannada-speakers as raw and strong, revealing another instance of fractal recursivity.

As I critically thought about this Reel, language ideologies jumped (albeit horizontally) like a parachute from background to foreground. It is definitely intriguing that so many ideologies are being packed and propagated unconsciously (or consciously) through what are meant to be fun, light and entertaining sixty-second videos.
