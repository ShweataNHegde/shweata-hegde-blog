Having given a few tech demos, Prof. Debayan’s mention of Douglas Engelbart's “Mother of All Demos (1968)” made me curious to watch it. The presentation was given at a conference in conjunction with a conference paper titled “A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect.”

Engelbart showcased the oNLine System's (NLS) features, such as file systems, text editors, and so on. He mentioned that his team used the consoles for “daily work,” perhaps making these the first-ever personal computers. It was interesting to see the seeds of what has now shaped current computers and the web, including hyperlinks, low-level and high-level languages, version control (bug and change trackers), compilers, file management, information retrieval, video conferencing, and so on.

I had kept my expectations low, given that it was an old demo, but the video showcased the ingenuity of Engelbart and his colleagues. They demoed live at this conference in San Francisco and accomplished connecting to the console seamlessly with the Augmentation Research Centre, some miles away at Stanford.

Among the functionalities demonstrated, I particularly liked the following:
- **Text file rendering**: I was struck by the clever data structuring and interactivity of the renders. The textual “statements” were also indexed, searchable, and hyperlinked. This is in stark contrast with the PDFs of 2024, which are unstructured and barely interactive.
- **File system hierarchy**.
- **The key set**, meant specifically for commands.
- **Filtering using what we would now call primitive regular expressions**: For example, there was a duty roster with role lists for all members. Using the compiler, one could filter for all members who knew, let us say, hardware.

### AI-Generated Summary of the Mother of All Demos

Bridging the first demo of a personal computer with present-day technologies of Generative AI, I used Notebook LM to summarize the features demonstrated in the video. It made me realize the warp-speed advancement of technology. In 1968, a scientist showcased a bulky console, and within five decades, these portable computers have become not only ubiquitous but also possess capabilities unimaginable to the Augmentation Research Centre scientists, who were at the origin of its development.

### Key Features (As Summarized by Notebook LM)

- **Hierarchical Structuring**: Enables the organization of information in a hierarchical manner, facilitating efficient navigation, overview, and manipulation of complex data.
- **View Control**: Allows dynamic adjustment of how information is displayed, enabling users to focus on specific details or gain an overview, adapting to different needs.
- **Hyperlinking (Jumping on Links)**: Facilitates navigation between different parts of a file or across multiple files, creating an interconnected network of information.
- **Cross-Referencing**: Supports linking between different parts of a document or different documents, enabling users to establish relationships and quickly access related information.
- **Content Analysis**: Offers a specialized language for creating search expressions, enabling sophisticated information retrieval based on content and patterns.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Includes features for real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to view, edit, and communicate on the same document.
- **Specialized Languages**: Utilizes a set of custom-designed languages, including control metalanguage, machine-oriented language (MOL), and content analysis language, to define system behavior, program functions, and facilitate precise communication.

### Unexplored Ideas

Although most of the technologies were eventually picked up by corporations making computers, the sophisticated ideas – such as how to interact with and organize knowledge, and how groups of people can work with computers to increase collective IQs – were never explored to their full potential. Given the advent of technology, perhaps it is time to revisit the “Mother of All Demos” and think about, as Engelbart says, “getting better at getting better.”
