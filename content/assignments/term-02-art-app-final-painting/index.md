#  Circles and Lines

Geometric patterns are fascinating; the more you look at them, the more they reveal. Like craftsmen from ancient times, I created this geometric pattern on the canvas by drawing circles and lines. The colours chosen for the motifs uncover various perspectives to observe the pattern. Pause and discover what this pattern reveals to you.

The geometric pattern painted is adapted from the book, "Islamic Geometric Pattern" by Eric Broug.
