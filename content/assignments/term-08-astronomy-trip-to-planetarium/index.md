As we left to visit the Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium on the 31st of May, I was quite excited. As a science communicator, I enjoy interacting with public engagement systems in India—be it museums, galleries, open days, or conferences. As someone who curates events for the public, it is sometimes good to become part of the public, experience the events through the lens of a citizen. Despite it being a hot summer day, I was ready to explore the planetarium.

The planetarium, situated next to a protected monument and across the Prime Minister’s Museum, was rightly positioned for more people to visit. On the day of our visit, there were many kids and parents who had come to see the shows. Although it was unfortunate that other parts of the planetarium were closed due to construction work, we managed to arrive well in time for the 1100 2-D show.

After we were seated in the dome-shaped room, we were set for the show. The show was off to a great start, with us being introduced to the solar system and the constellations. But I soon started to feel a bit disappointed. Yes, there were a lot of exciting screams by the young audience, however, I felt that the videos were shallow in breadth and did not instigate a critical engagement with astronomy. They were informative, slightly awe-inspiring at the very most. The planetarium could expand its vision to serve more purposes, such as bringing the latest discoveries to the public, introducing lesser-known stories of scientists in astronomy, bringing to the foreground the vastness of the universe and the current unknowns with dark matter, dark energy, explaining how astronomical discoveries are made, etc. In fact, I was thinking about several videos available online created by amazing science communicators, such as the visualisation of [How Earth Moves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJhgZBn-LHg) by VSauce, the [Cosmic Ladder explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFMaT9oRbs4) by 3B1B, and so on, which could be turned into animations that can be showcased in planetariums. There was also a paucity of India-specific content, except for mention of constellation names in Hindu mythology.

The planetarium experience in itself could have been more immersive, for example, a video touring the insides of a star or a neighbouring galaxy. Thinking further, planetariums should also consider integrating the technologies of the present—touchscreen LED screens, virtual reality and 3-D visualisations. Instead of a set video being displayed, the audience could have an opportunity to explore at their own pace. Another lack was the absence of space for conversations; perhaps having mediators or experts who could explain some concepts in person would have added depth to the experience.

Since these planetariums in India were built in memory of Jawaharlal Nehru, I was reminded of his writings about the scientific temper. In The Discovery of India, he said, “The applications of science are inevitable and unavoidable for all countries and peoples today. But something more than its application is necessary. It is the scientific approach, the adventurous and yet critical temper of science, the search for truth and new knowledge, the refusal to accept anything without testing and trial, the capacity to change previous conclusions in the face of new evidence, the reliance on observed fact and not on pre-conceived theory, the hard discipline of the mind — all this is necessary, not merely for the application of science but for life itself and the solution of its many problems…(Jawaharlal Nehru, 1946, p.512)”. The planetarium, although it attempts to imbibe a scientific temper in Indian citizens, still lacks the criticality in its content to fully deliver the vision.

Finally, even the solar telescope session ended up taking a lot of time, and all of us lost patience, and there was very little time for learning. This made me realise (yet again) that a conducive environment is critical for meaningful public engagement; even logistical issues such as set-up time for telescopes need to be accounted for when organising such events.

The whole trip for me reinforced the need for greater science communication and public engagement efforts. With the majority of India’s population being the youth, there is a huge gap in the resources and engagement avenues available for citizens to be involved in science or be informed about the latest developments in science. Although Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium is a good effort in that direction, there is room for major improvements for it to become an enabling space for astronomy conversation and inspire our youth to make their discoveries.
