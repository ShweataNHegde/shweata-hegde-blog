# The Power of Scientific Illustrations


_“To develop a complete mind: Study the science of art; study the art of science. Learn how to see. Realise that everything connects to everything else.” - Leonardo Da Vinci_

As a non-artist in biology classes, I was always in awe of botany and zoology professors who drew detailed diagrams of, let’s say, a dissected flower part or insect organ on the chalkboard. The professors captured all the details a photograph would, except that the diagram was better at spotlighting the key characteristics of the specimen. To draw such a detailed diagram, one observes patiently and records – skills valuable to any researcher. Therefore, as biology students, we were encouraged to draw, even if we didn’t come with the skillset of an artist.

One might find scientific illustrations – especially of plants, trees, animals, insects – obsolete in the digital age. However, that’s far from being true. In this essay, using case studies, I will outline in-depth how scientific illustrations are an invaluable tool in the scientific process in the 21st century.
Illustrations visualise the unseeable

Beyond botanical or anatomical diagrams, illustration skills are useful in visualising abstract concepts. Cellular and molecular biology involves studying structures smaller than the wavelength of light. Drawing models of microscopic structures such as cells and molecules helps a researcher understand biological processes, and generate and communicate ideas (Iwasa). Described below are three such innovations: 

## 1.1. Ribbon Structures of Protein
In 1960, Max Perutz and John Kendrew deciphered the structure of a protein for the first time using X-ray crystallography. That protein was haemoglobin, which is responsible for oxygen transportation in humans. Once the technique was established, more protein structures were discovered. Representing these protein structures became a problem. Although proteins are small molecules, they are made up of several thousands of individual atoms making it hard for scientists to make molecular models. In the early days of structural biology, there came a need to devise a method to visualise these structures in order to communicate the findings to the scientific community.

Richardson’s ribbon structures became a consistent system for drawing proteins. Quoting Richardson herself, “Ribbon drawings are an excellent tool for first comprehending the overall organisation of a protein structure, on which cones can later hang the important details.” These ribbon structures are ubiquitously used in scientific papers and high school textbooks.

To solve the visualisation problem, Jane Richardson, a biochemist, developed the innovative ribbon diagrams. Recapping high school biology, protein consists of a chain of amino acids that naturally fold to form a 3-D structure. Linus Pauling showed that there are two basic shapes protein parts take up: alpha helices and beta strands. In Richardson’s sketches, “alpha helices are coils that look like the tails of decorative ribbons, curled with the edge of a pair of scissors. Beta strands are arrows that point in the direction in which the amino acid chain was built”. (Saplakoglu)

1.2. Cellular Landscapes
Zooming out from protein, we move onto cells. Until the 1960s, the cell icon resembled an omelette, with the blob of the nucleus surrounded by cytoplasm. In 1961, with advancement in technology, the icon was replaced by the cell’s illustration showcasing the subcellular structures.

An innovative representation of cells came in the 1990s. David Goodsell, a structural biologist, studying biological molecules  started making illustrations of cells showcasing the complexity of cells at the molecular level. Goodsell uses scientific data from crystallography and microscopy to draw the structures of macromolecules, such as proteins. He combines the structural data of individual molecules with information on their interaction with other molecules and their position, size, and so on to develop a cellular landscape. The resultant is an illustration that depicts artistically the complexity of a cell and accurately represents biological processes. He has a distinctive style for his painting. He uses watercolours and simple pastel colours for molecules.

Inspired by cellular landscape paintings, several scientists including Goodsell himself have developed molecular graphics software to make digital illustrations of various cells, cellular parts, and pathogen interactions. One such example is Animation Lab.
Illustrations frame the unframable and focus beyond photographs
Conventional Botanical Illustrations
History of botanical illustrations go back to the 15th century all the way back to Leonardo Da Vinci and perhaps earlier. However, botanical illustrations are still relevant in the present times. Since an artist can observe specimens from various angles and magnifications, they can develop a single drawing with the characteristics features of the species.

Trees
Imagine being a wildlife conservationist interested in visually documenting trees of rainforests. How would one fathom clicking a picture such that a 110-foot beast like Vernona Arborea (seen in the Western Ghats) is captured in a single frame? Two conversationalists, Divya Mudappa and TR Shankar Raman of the Nature Conservation Foundation, ran into this problem and decided to collaborate with Nirupa Rao, a botanical illustrator. Through the collaboration project, they documented 30 regional trees.

In her TED video, Rao admits that drawing trees is difficult. To draw a single tree, she had to observe the buttress by standing in front of it and climbing the cliff to observe the canopy. She also had to consistently observe the changes for months to draw all the organs (flower, fruit, and so on). By combining data points gathered spatially and temporally, she came up with a single illustration that had all the details of the tree, something a photograph or series of photographs could never achieve.

Rao has also documented rare species and biological events such as the blooming of Neelakurinji.

Conclusion
These case studies show that the scientific process relies heavily on the innovations of illustrations. From proteins to trees, science has progressed because of researcher-artists' contributions to enabling communication and the common language of visuals in the scientific community.
