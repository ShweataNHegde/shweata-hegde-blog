      <title>Term 03 | The New Geography of Information Age | Extension Notes 06: Is Censorship the Right Way to Go? Science Communication Perspective</title>

      <description>Given our conversation in class about the complex issue of censorship on social media, I explored the role of censorship in science communication. At first glance, one might argue that removing non-factual content, such as &amp;ldquo;vaccines cause autism&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;plant X has proven to cure Y disease,&amp;rdquo; might be the best option to prevent its further spread. However, the problem is that non-factual content is complicated and takes many forms—misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories—all of which require different approaches to address.</description>

      <description>As a family, we seldom went out to the town together; naturally, whenever we did, it was memorable. One such event was registering for our Aadhar cards. One day after school, my parents and I went to a registration center near the famous temple in the town. I had no idea what Aadhar was, and my parents did not explain it either. It was a small shop with benches, and it was unusually crowded.</description>

      <title>Term 03 | The New Geography of Information Age | Extension Notes 05: Split Brain Experiment: Is it Oversimplified?</title>

      <description>As someone who studied biology during undergrad, I was surprised to have not heard about the Split Brain Experiment (which probably shows my slight disinterest in neuroscience). Prof. Debayan’s descriptions of patients behaving oddly after their callosotomy—a procedure disconnecting the two halves of the brain—made me probe further.
Searching YouTube landed me on the most popular video on this topic by the CGP Grey channel. It described the experiments conducted in the late 19th century on split-brain patients by Sperry et al.</description>

      <description>Anti-Vaxxers &amp;ndash; Where Are They? Decades of research show that vaccines save lives. However, there are communities of people known as anti-vaxxers who hesitate or refuse to get vaccinated. When faced with devastating pandemics like COVID-19, this &amp;ldquo;vaccine hesitancy&amp;rdquo; poses a threat to humanity. The advent of social media has only complicated the issue, providing opportunities for anti-vaxxers to spread misinformation.
As part of the Extension Notes, I looked at YouTube comments on:</description>

      <description>Having given a few tech demos, Prof. Debayan’s mention of Douglas Engelbart&amp;rsquo;s “Mother of All Demos (1968)” made me curious to watch it. The presentation was given at a conference in conjunction with a conference paper titled “A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect.”
Engelbart showcased the oNLine System&amp;rsquo;s (NLS) features, such as file systems, text editors, and so on. He mentioned that his team used the consoles for “daily work,” perhaps making these the first-ever personal computers.</description>

      <description>After listening to Prof. Debayan explain blockchain, I started looking for avenues, apart from cryptocurrencies, where such a decentralized system could be used. Previously, as part of a research project, I had spent a considerable amount of time understanding the current scientific publishing ecosystem, only to realize that it lacks transparency and is gatekept by a few companies. Further, the competitive nature of scientific publishing has caused nuanced problems, such as p-hacking, data fudging, and the reproducibility crisis.</description>

      <description>Understanding Big Data Analysis Behind Recommender Systems and Other Algorithms
Despite friends discussing targeted advertising and giant companies tracking online activities, I had not bothered learning more about cookies or user profiling. I knew enough to ensure I checked the “Reject All” option whenever I visited a website, but I did not know the implications of not doing so. As Prof. Debayan explained how ad companies such as DoubleClick track me across websites to gather insights about my preferences and thereby show relevant advertisements, I became aware of my ignorance.</description>

      <description>Term 03 officially begins. I am excited for the courses this time. We have Microeconomics and The New Geography in the Information Age (NGIA) &amp;ndash; a funky name but it is a course on information in the age of internet. This week features me singing, reading a lot, working on Chevening Application, spending time with the cohort and having quality time with Karthik.
2024-10-28 First day of Term 03. We had to back-to-back lectures.</description>

      <description>2024-10-21 Woke up early today. Journalled, showered, worked on the Critical Wriitng researched project and journalled even more. The website has finally caught up to the present day. Having been deep into Climate Game work, our ELM team took a break from work, so I spent my time on Chevening application. Drafting these essays is hard. Sometimes you feel great looking at your past work summarised, and at other times you feel stuck, doubting yourself.</description>

      <description>Days: 2024-10-07 to 2024-10-20
Final two weeks of Term 02, Week 11 and 12, were filled with deadlines. As a result, I was stressed, confused, tired, agititated (fought with Karthik quite a lot). I feel like or even have the time to journal as you can tell. But we have made it through. Here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt at recounting key events from the two weeks.
At glance, here was my deadline list.</description>

      <description>“To develop a complete mind: Study the science of art; study the art of science. Learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else.” - Leonardo Da Vinci
As a non-artist in biology classes, I was always in awe of botany and zoology professors who drew detailed diagrams of, let’s say, a dissected flower part or insect organ on the chalkboard. The professors captured all the details a photograph would, except that the diagram was better at spotlighting the key characteristics of the specimen.</description>

      <description>Circles and Lines Geometric patterns are fascinating; the more you look at them, the more they reveal. Like craftsmen from ancient times, I created this geometric pattern on the canvas by drawing circles and lines. The colours chosen for the motifs uncover various perspectives to observe the pattern. Pause and discover what this pattern reveals to you.
The geometric pattern painted is adapted from the book, &amp;ldquo;Islamic Geometric Pattern&amp;rdquo; by Eric Broug.</description>

      <description>2024-09-30 Thanks to the stage reading sessions, I fully read The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet. Later in the evening, we had the first lecture where we discussed the play. I finally get how literature classroom discussions work. Prof. Menon only posed questions and kept probing for answers from us. We collectively make sense of the concepts by contributing our understandings. It&amp;rsquo;s very rare for a STEM class to be democratic like that.</description>

      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;m writing the account a week later, it&amp;rsquo;ll be brief.
We had the last set of Art Appreciation classes. We looked at different art movements &amp;ndash; renaissance to performance art. I performed My Heart Will Go On in the farewell class. I got nervous, yet again. Being around talented people all the time can do that for you.
I spent the first half of the week writing the Expression of Interest to have Prof.</description>

2024-09-17 Repeat of Monday. Spent a lot of time talking to Karthik and scrolling on phone.
2024-09-18 Slept all day again. Felt slightly better. It was interesting how my life was just about surviving one day at a time.</description>

      <description>After living in Mysore (a quiet city in Karnataka) for most of my life, I moved to Bengaluru last year for work. Naturally, I bumped into more non-kannada-speaking folks than usual, and English became my go-to language. Nothing to fret about. All my life I’ve enjoyed speaking in English. I took pride in being fluent in the language at school and even college. I often said I think in English. I had no issues giving presentations, making points in meetings, or having casual conversations at the workplace.</description>

      <description>Over the course, we had 4 group assignments, which required us to use statistical tools like z-score, t-test, chi-squared test, etc in various scenarios. I decided to use Python to do all analyses. Looking back, it was a nice way to practice coding while also learning new concepts.

      <description>In July 2022, all my undergrad classmates were hustling to figure out Masters, jobs, etc. On the other hand, I boldly decided to take a year off. No plans. A year for myself.
Thus the adventurous journey began, journey that took me to 5 big cities, and taught me life and career lessons. I am documenting experiences here for the future me to look back on.

In a month&amp;rsquo;s time, I will be back to being a student. Probably for the first time, my education will be worthy of time and investment. What sold YIF for me is an that it&amp;rsquo;s all-in-one package. I&amp;rsquo;m learning history, economics, statistics, astrophysics, climate, leadership, writing, and many other disciplines and skills.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s weather was weird. The sun was not fully out in the morning. It suddenly rained in the afternoon. Later, the sun shone bright for a while before the pouring rain hit the ground.
I took this picture late afternoon before the second rain. Funnily, I had never fully explored this part of the Old NCBS building. They have nice outdoor spaces!
As I took the picture, I realised how my time here at the BLiSc campus resembles today&amp;rsquo;s weather.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of the exam season. I have an exam in two hours. But here I am, sitting on my bed facing the same pink curtain and the fairy light, reflecting on my time in Room No. 122. In a week, the room won&amp;rsquo;t be mine.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder about the stories the room holds, stories that I (or anyone who comes next) will never know. The hostel is close to 70 years old, which means more than 150 people lived in this room before me.</description>
