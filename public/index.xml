      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have taken to swimming! I probably should have updated here sooner. In the beginning of May, Arushi convinced me to get swimdress and go to pool. The first day was the scariest. It was almost as if I had forgotten how the body feels when it&amp;rsquo;s inside something that is 100 times more dense than the air it is used to. But over the weeks, I have gotten better. I can kick and propel forward. I have been doing breathing drills; hopefully I will be able to combine all these and learn to swim soon. Swimming is one of the few things that has given me back the joy of learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Term 06 | Can Scientific Temperament Help Build a Better Welfare State?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-06-the-welfare-state/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most rhetoric about the welfare state revolves around the mechanics and politics of schemes related to social protection, social assistance, and social rights such as—education, healthcare, food, and employment. However, abstracting our way out from this detailed perspective and instead looking at the Welfare State as a whole, we realise that “the welfare state is a distinctive form of governmentality: a specific mode of constituting the economy, assuring social security, and guaranteeing social provision (Garland, D., 2014)”. In this essay, I argue that scientific temperament should be one of the core pillars—if not the pillar—of this form of governmentality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Term 06 | Op-Ed | India&#39;s Foreign Policy | Need for a Science Policy Discourse in Formal Research Spaces</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a student of science and education at a government college, I had no encouragement to keep up with current affairs. After all, my tasks were that of “pure science” like running experiments in labs. However, as years passed, I started having a more outward look, beyond the lab, and realised that science happens not in isolation. The very establishment where I perform experiments is shaped by societal context, and most importantly, local, national and global politics. For instance, if the funding agencies decided to cut funding to my institution, I would not have the chemicals to perform experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Twin orphaned bear cubs given shelter near India-Pakistan border”, read a Reuters News headline. In 2021, two Asiatic Bear cubs were found on the Pakistani side of Kashmir. Unable to open their eyes, the cubs could barely manage to crawl away from the border. Their mother? She was never to be found on the Pakistani side; she was probably killed at the Indian border, either due to the fencing or landmines. The long-standing disputes between India and Pakistan have led to the two countries taking extreme measures; the electric fence being one of them. The fencing of the Line Of Control (LoC) completed in 2004 was meant to prevent the illegal entry of militants. But it has inadvertently also caused incredible damage to habitats at the border—spanning cold deserts, mountains and hot deserts. Locals and forest officials on both sides of the border recount countless stories of lost wildlife—such as separated cubs, deer injured by landmines, or leopards killed for human safety—all as a direct consequence of border control and fencing. But who is to listen? Both countries are too busy strategising their next wars or attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Term 06 | The Welfare State | Critical Reading Notes on Bread For All (Introduction)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-06-the-welfare-state-critical-notes-02/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading excerpts from Bread For All by Chris Renwick was my first introduction to Social History. I found Social History fascinating because it weaves together the lived experiences of people from the past. What piqued my interest was how there are certain culminating events in history—such as the Beveridge Report becoming popular—but the event in itself does not tell us the whole story. It is only when we situate that event in the mundane of every day and look at the ideas of the time, does the real picture of the past emerges. In that regard, I was drawn to the work of journalist Charles Madge, the anthropologist Tom Harrisson, and the filmmaker Humphrey Jennings in documenting the “Collective unconscious” through  “Mass-Observations”.  In particular, there was this statement on why British people, particularly middle-class people, were having smaller families than they had in the past, which read: “People lacked faith in the future. Not a belief that things are going to be tough, and it will take a long time to get right &amp;hellip; But a belief that nobody’s going to try and put things right and improve them, that the nation is going to muddle on through the chaoses [sic] of another 1919–39 to another world war in 1965.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At my previous workplace, I was involved in public health communication for rare genetic diseases. Our team’s table read of the National Policy for Rare Diseases (NPRD), 2021, exposed me to the intricacies of India’s present-day healthcare system. We had extensive discussions about how essential services—such as genetic counseling, newborn screening, and early detection of non-communicable diseases—should be part of the Primary Health Care (PHC) system. Adding to these conversations was The India Forum article, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theindiaforum.in/health/right-healthcare-times-universal-health-coverage&#34;&gt;Right to Healthcare in Times of Universal Health Coverage&lt;/a&gt;, which gave me a framework to think about and possibly reimagine the healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I never quite managed to post here again, despite having a rather light term. Times have changed very much. I think it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say that I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will ever have a &amp;rsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; educational experience, without any global challenges jeopardising it. India-Pakistan conflict has intensified over the last week. My heart goes out to all the people the bordering regions on both sides. Although I am priveleged enough to not having to worry about a missile hitting my building (not yet, at least), I still can&amp;rsquo;t help but be anxious, consume as much news as possible. I want to go back home. I am worried that I might get landlocked if I don&amp;rsquo;t act swiftly. But, on the other hand, I feel guilty whenever thoughts of fleeing down to the south comes to mind. What about those who don&amp;rsquo;t have the option of traveling back home? What of those who cannot afford to go back home? I feel selfish for choosing me over others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The new term finally began :) After tireless days working on ELM presentations, game nights, interviews, essays and assignments, we made it out of the busiest period of the Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really excited (I still am) for all three of my courses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design Thinking and Innovation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language Politics and Society&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sustainable Development: How Can We Align Social Justice, Biodiversity Conservation and Climate Action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this will be one of my favourite terms after term 01 where we had statistics and history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/week-23-to-32/&#34;&gt;catch-up&lt;/a&gt; post, I have been shortlisted for Chevening interview. Ever since I heard the news on the 14th Feb., I have been excited and anxious. However, anxiety is slowly taking over. It&amp;rsquo;s been over a month, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have put enough efforts to prepare. I still don&amp;rsquo;t know how I would answer most of the questions. What kind of funny human am I? I really want the scholarship, but I am not able to actively work towards telling my story in the interview. I am overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information and advice online. What to focus on? What is relevant to me? I am also overwhelmed by the difficulty of the challenge ahead of me. With 50 students being selected for the scholarship, my probabilities of getting it is so low. Knowing this piece of information has only inhibited me from preparing for the interview, which as I write out, sounds so counter-intuitive. Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t I be preparing more rigoursly?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Term 06 has begun. We have &amp;ldquo;Deconstructing Indian Foreign Policy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Welfare State&amp;rdquo;. These courses are very outside of my comfort zone. However, I have not been able to give these courses the time they deserve because of climate and WSCI presentations. I was disappointed by the fact that I did not get to present my climate group assignment; the professor cut me off because we were running late for dinner. Similarly, our WSCI project was also controversial in some sense, but I personally did not receive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I meant to write more frequently, however, it seems like I have not managed to be disciplined enough yet again. As it is always the case, a LOT has happened. Any attempt to capture or document these few months would be an unfruitful exercise. Instead, I will quickly summarise some key events before resuming my usual weekly updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;term-4-2024-12-24-to-2025-01-10-making-videos-after-videos&#34;&gt;Term 4 (2024-12-24 to 2025-01-10): Making videos after videos!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After returning, I was immersed into a block-taught course called Visual Storytelling and Cinematic Techniques. Looking back, it was a very useful course. I, for the first time, learnt video production and acting. From direction insights such as camera angles, shot types, cutaways, continuity, to technicalities of video editing&amp;mdash;we learnt it all. Naturally, the classes were quite intense, packed from morning to evening. Additionally, our ELM had added responsibilities of preparing for the India Science Festival, where we were showcasing the board game version of Pralay. I still remember those cold and gloomy winter evenings, when I forced myself to get out of my room to meet the team to discuss the logistics of making the game. It all came together at the very last moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Term 05 | Climate Change: The Challenge of Communication</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-05-climate-and-geopolitics-paper/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-05-climate-and-geopolitics-paper/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my final term assignment for the Climate and Geopolitics course at the Young India Fellowship, I was doing some readings about the likelihood of exceeding the maximum wet-bulb temperature (the measure of the combination temperature and humidity) due to anthropogenic climate change. The papers were technical, however, I knew enough scientific jargon to grasp the apocalypse predicted. One of the papers read, “under RCP8.5, a small fraction of the South Asian population (~4%) is projected to experience TWmax [maximum wet bulb temperature] exceeding 35°C by 2100. However, approximately 75% of the population is projected to experience TWmax exceeding 31°C, considered dangerous levels for most humans…” (Im et al.). This made me wonder: Are the people living in the regions-to-be-affected aware of the future they are about to face, let alone be prepared? Worse, “the geographical locations of the most extreme projected heat waves in the Indus and Ganges river valleys coincide largely with locations of highly vulnerable human populations in terms of population density, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and agricultural intensity” (Im et al.). How does one even talk about future projections when these vulnerable communities have more immediate problems of livelihood and survival to deal with in the present?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2024&amp;mdash;the year full of turbulence. After crusing through 2022 and 2023, 2024 felt like a reality check. When I look back on the year, I only see disappointments, rejections, fights, poor health and lost confidence. However, all of the experiences have also taught me life lessons. Hopefully, as a result, I find myself more resilient in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the first half of the year doing applications, getting rejections and some acceptances. It was stressful to balance work at TIGS and write compelling applications. TIGS sadly never was a fertile ground for my ideas to grow. I felt undervalued and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t deliver my best either. The experience overall made me doubt whether I would make a good science communicator. I also fell sick in March and I never felt healthy since then. After many deliberations I decided to the Young India Fellowship. I was unsure if it was going to be useful and whether I would be able to manage the workload. Giving up my dream of doing a Masters abroad was hard, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had one of the most colorful weeks of 2024. December was indeed an interesting curveball I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2024-12-22&#34;&gt;2024-12-22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last day of Organizational Dynamics. It started at 0930. The lectures were boring, honestly. In the afternoon, we were given the final group assignment to express our learnings from the course through a creative piece. Although I was initially hesitant, I ended up dancing with the group. It was definitely a memorable experience, and I am super grateful to my team.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Past 15 days of Organisational Dynamics course has been a mush. I am constantly startled by the fact that it has only been running for the past 15 days. Feels like life has been this 0900 to 1900 grind forever. Simulations, readings, co-education, instructor-led group discussions&amp;mdash;argh, I was always surrounded by people. Some days were great, others weren&amp;rsquo;t. However, it was the very same people who made it easier. I grew closer to my cohort and am finally starting to feel like I belong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Given our conversation in class about the complex issue of censorship on social media, I explored the role of censorship in science communication. At first glance, one might argue that removing non-factual content, such as &amp;ldquo;vaccines cause autism&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;plant X has proven to cure Y disease,&amp;rdquo; might be the best option to prevent its further spread. However, the problem is that non-factual content is complicated and takes many forms—misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories—all of which require different approaches to address.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a family, we seldom went out to the town together; naturally, whenever we did, it was memorable. One such event was registering for our Aadhar cards. One day after school, my parents and I went to a registration center near the famous temple in the town. I had no idea what Aadhar was, and my parents did not explain it either. It was a small shop with benches, and it was unusually crowded. As a jumpy 10-year-old, I did not want to wait. Hours passed. When our turn finally came, I realized why the process took so long: the biometrics. People had to try multiple times before their biometrics were recorded. Of course, this was in the early days, somewhere around 2010, and the process, I am sure, is a lot smoother now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Term 03 | The New Geography of Information Age | Extension Notes 05: Split Brain Experiment: Is it Oversimplified?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-03-ngia-essay-05/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-03-ngia-essay-05/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As someone who studied biology during undergrad, I was surprised to have not heard about the Split Brain Experiment (which probably shows my slight disinterest in neuroscience). Prof. Debayan’s descriptions of patients behaving oddly after their callosotomy—a procedure disconnecting the two halves of the brain—made me probe further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching YouTube landed me on the most &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfYbgdo8e-8&#34;&gt;popular video&lt;/a&gt; on this topic by the CGP Grey channel. It described the experiments conducted in the late 19th century on split-brain patients by Sperry et al., which revealed the different specializations of the left and right hemispheres of the brain, a phenomenon known as lateralization. However, I found certain phrasings in the video questionable. Specifically, it claimed that “you are two,” meaning that there are two separate minds in an individual—the linguistic “left brain” and visual-processing “right brain.” It speculates that, in non-split-brain individuals, the “right brain rose up as a companion without a choice.” The video ends with a deeply unsettling thought: “At this moment, in your normal head, there are two of you watching this video: one having a &amp;lsquo;mind-blown&amp;rsquo; moment, and the other mentally rolling its eyes at the obviousness of it all.” I found this perspective—that there are two separate conscious agents—somewhat misinterpreting the experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Decades of research show that vaccines save lives. However, there are communities of people known as anti-vaxxers who hesitate or refuse to get vaccinated. When faced with devastating pandemics like COVID-19, this &amp;ldquo;vaccine hesitancy&amp;rdquo; poses a threat to humanity. The advent of social media has only complicated the issue, providing opportunities for anti-vaxxers to spread misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Term 03 | The New Geography of Information Age | Extension Notes 03: Reviewing &#39;Mother of All Demos&#39;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having given a few tech demos, Prof. Debayan’s mention of Douglas Engelbart&amp;rsquo;s “Mother of All Demos (1968)” made me curious to watch it. The presentation was given at a conference in conjunction with a conference paper titled “A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UhpTiWyVa6k?si=Sya6XDw4omvSxCjt&amp;amp;start=1&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engelbart showcased the oNLine System&amp;rsquo;s (NLS) features, such as file systems, text editors, and so on. He mentioned that his team used the consoles for “daily work,” perhaps making these the first-ever personal computers. It was interesting to see the seeds of what has now shaped current computers and the web, including hyperlinks, low-level and high-level languages, version control (bug and change trackers), compilers, file management, information retrieval, video conferencing, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Term 03 | The New Geography of Information Age | Extension Notes 02: Blockchain for Scientific Publishing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After listening to Prof. Debayan explain blockchain, I started looking for avenues, apart from cryptocurrencies, where such a decentralized system could be used. Previously, as part of a research project, I had spent a considerable amount of time understanding the current scientific publishing ecosystem, only to realize that it lacks transparency and is gatekept by a few companies. Further, the competitive nature of scientific publishing has caused nuanced problems, such as p-hacking, data fudging, and the reproducibility crisis. Since publishing is vital to the scientific process, I wondered if blockchain technology could solve some of these problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Big Data Analysis Behind Recommender Systems and Other Algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite friends discussing targeted advertising and giant companies tracking online activities, I had not bothered learning more about cookies or user profiling. I knew enough to ensure I checked the “Reject All” option whenever I visited a website, but I did not know the implications of not doing so. As Prof. Debayan explained how ad companies such as DoubleClick track me across websites to gather insights about my preferences and thereby show relevant advertisements, I became aware of my ignorance. I also realized that targeted advertising involves analyzing huge amounts of data and became curious to learn more about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Term 03 officially begins. I am excited for the courses this time. We have Microeconomics and The New Geography in the Information Age (NGIA) &amp;ndash; a funky name but it is a course on information in the age of internet. This week features me singing, reading a lot, working on Chevening Application, spending time with the cohort and having quality time with Karthik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2024-10-28&#34;&gt;2024-10-28&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First day of Term 03. We had to back-to-back lectures. Woke up early, made it to class 20 minutes before it started. Prof. A. K. Shivkumar from Harvard is teaching us Microeconomics. I like his lecture-approach, simple whiteobard and marker style. We were acquainted with the basics of microeconomics. The problems of the society &amp;ndash; what to produce, how to produce them, how much. We discussed the need for intervention of the market &amp;ndash; supply-side and demand-side. We ended with with model of economy. In the last half an hour of the class, we looked at the case study: India in numbers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Woke up early today. Journalled, showered, worked on the Critical Wriitng researched project and journalled even more. The website has finally caught up to the present day. Having been deep into Climate Game work, our ELM team took a break from work, so I spent my time on Chevening application. Drafting these essays is hard. Sometimes you feel great looking at your past work summarised, and at other times you feel stuck, doubting yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Days: 2024-10-07 to 2024-10-20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final two weeks of Term 02, Week 11 and 12, were filled with deadlines. As a result, I was stressed, confused, tired, agititated (fought with Karthik quite a lot). I feel like or even have the time to journal as you can tell. But we have made it through. Here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt at recounting key events from the two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At glance, here was my deadline list. Art Appreciation and Shakespeare combined, I had 5 assignments, a conference presentation (The Tech We Want), meeting with Prof. Vijayraghavan, a scholarship application (I discontinued working on it).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“To develop a complete mind: Study the science of art; study the art of science. Learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else.” - Leonardo Da Vinci&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a non-artist in biology classes, I was always in awe of botany and zoology professors who drew detailed diagrams of, let’s say, a dissected flower part or insect organ on the chalkboard. The professors captured all the details a photograph would, except that the diagram was better at spotlighting the key characteristics of the specimen. To draw such a detailed diagram, one observes patiently and records — skills valuable to any researcher. Therefore, as biology students, we were encouraged to draw, even if we didn’t come with the skillset of an artist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Geometric patterns are fascinating; the more you look at them, the more they reveal. Like craftsmen from ancient times, I created this geometric pattern on the canvas by drawing circles and lines. The colours chosen for the motifs uncover various perspectives to observe the pattern. Pause and discover what this pattern reveals to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geometric pattern painted is adapted from the book, &amp;ldquo;Islamic Geometric Pattern&amp;rdquo; by Eric Broug.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the stage reading sessions, I fully read &lt;em&gt;The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt;. Later in the evening, we had the first lecture where we discussed the play. I finally get how literature classroom discussions work. Prof. Menon only posed questions and kept probing for answers from us. We collectively make sense of the concepts by contributing our understandings. It&amp;rsquo;s very rare for a STEM class to be democratic like that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;m writing the account a week later, it&amp;rsquo;ll be brief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had the last set of Art Appreciation classes. We looked at different art movements &amp;ndash; renaissance to performance art. I performed My Heart Will Go On in the farewell class. I got nervous, yet again. Being around talented people all the time can do that for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the first half of the week writing the Expression of Interest to have Prof. Vijayraghavan as my mentor at the YIF. I have been an advocate for open science since I learnt about it. But in writing to Prof. Vijayraghavan, I collated by scattered thoughts about open science in India to coherent narrative. I collasced my interests in science communication and open science. Prathima Muniyappa, an alum of the YIF, had told me about thinking in first principles. I finally noticed commonality two separate career trajectories of mine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Monday began with breakfast in bed and trip to the infirmary. I was told that I might have caught a stomach bug. Slept all day except to eat and shit multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2024-09-17&#34;&gt;2024-09-17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeat of Monday. Spent a lot of time talking to Karthik and scrolling on phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2024-09-18&#34;&gt;2024-09-18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slept all day again. Felt slightly better. It was interesting how my life was just about surviving one day at a time. I also discovered that social media has changed a lot since I last checked in. I stumbled across a lot of regional &amp;lsquo;content creators&amp;rsquo;. Gone are the days where there was little Indian representation online.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After living in Mysore (a quiet city in Karnataka) for most of my life, I moved to Bengaluru last year for work. Naturally, I bumped into more non-kannada-speaking folks than usual, and English became my go-to language. Nothing to fret about. All my life I’ve enjoyed speaking in English. I took pride in being fluent in the language at school and even college. I often said I think in English. I had no issues giving presentations, making points in meetings, or having casual conversations at the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the assignments was to make a video about ourself. I was quite apprehensive at first. But I realised it&amp;rsquo;s a good practice to concisely tell a story about yourself. This is my attempt at telling a story about how I got into science communication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the course, we had 4 group assignments, which required us to use statistical tools like z-score, t-test, chi-squared test, etc in various scenarios. I decided to use Python to do all analyses. Looking back, it was a nice way to practice coding while also learning new concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time is flying! New term from this week. We have two interesting courses, Art Appreciation (by Prof. Anunaya Chaubey) and Shakespeare and the World (Prof. Jonathan Gil Harris and Prof. Madhavi Menon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;daily-breakdown&#34;&gt;Daily Breakdown&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2024-09-09&#34;&gt;2024-09-09&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an uncomfortable experience during the first Art Appreciation class. Prof. asked to paint a canvas in an hour, give it a title, make note of challenges and display. I made an embarassingly bad painting. I was almost in tears after looking around and seeing amazing art works. I felt even worse because of how I reacted. I wish I was slightly better at dealing with being sucky at something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Through the course, I learnt about various statistical tools and concept. But I also explored how to run them in Python. So, it only makes sense for my final report to be an interactive Python file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;part-a&#34;&gt;Part A&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose three of the four following statistical tools (A.1 – A.4). For each of your chosen three, write a short response exhibiting your understanding of the tool (250 words maximum each).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;After struggling for many months to perfect my CV, I finally finished creating one. I was asked by a professor to share my CV so he could look for a potential PhD advisor if I&amp;rsquo;m interested in pursuing one. I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://joinsuperset.com/&#34;&gt;Superset CV builder&lt;/a&gt;. Although it was clunky (with edit widget being too small and it taking forever to load), it helped me format my CV and restrict it to a page. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;ve done a good job at describing my work experience. We were asked to use the PAR Framework (Problem-Action-Result), but I got to lazy and copy-pasted details from my older resumes and modified a bit for consistency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, all my undergrad classmates were hustling to figure out Masters, jobs, etc.  On the other hand, I boldly decided to take a year off. No plans. A year for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the adventurous journey began, journey that took me to 5 big cities, and taught me life and career lessons. I am documenting experiences here for the future me to look back on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yay! I got selected to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ashoka.edu.in/academic-programme/young-india-fellowship/&#34;&gt;Young India Fellowship (YIF)&lt;/a&gt; 2025. Taking a gap year after undergrad was risky, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy that it led me to the YIF. In a month&amp;rsquo;s time, I will be back to being a student. Probably for the first time, my education will be worthy of time and investment. What sold YIF for me is an that it&amp;rsquo;s all-in-one package. I&amp;rsquo;m learning history, economics, statistics, astrophysics, climate, leadership, writing, and many other disciplines and skills. And my peers are fully committed to the Fellowship, it seemed like! During my undergrad, none of us really wanted to learn from our classes. We didn&amp;rsquo;t engage in critical discussions or bother putting any efforts into assignments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Random Day at BLiSc</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s weather was weird. The sun was not fully out in the morning. It suddenly rained in the afternoon. Later, the sun shone bright for a while before the pouring rain hit the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took this picture late afternoon before the second rain. Funnily, I had never fully explored this part of the Old NCBS building. They have nice outdoor spaces!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I took the picture, I realised how my time here at the BLiSc campus resembles today&amp;rsquo;s weather. I had a gloomy start, things went downhill, but I pulled myself back up for some sunshine moments, and now it&amp;rsquo;s back to being gloomy again. It&amp;rsquo;s been a wild three months. Living alone, exploring by myself, making and losing acquaintances, pulling together an international trip from scratch, running the podcast, navigating new workspace and tasks, and doing applications. No wonder I feel overwhelmed. But like there is beauty in these rain-soaked flowers facing the somewhat blue sky, there is one in my struggles and successes, too. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to keep chugging along. I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to this place for its lessons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of the exam season. I have an exam in two hours. But here I am, sitting on my bed facing the same pink curtain and the fairy light, reflecting on my time in Room No. 122. In a week, the room won&amp;rsquo;t be mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder about the stories the room holds, stories that I (or anyone who comes next) will never know. The hostel is close to 70 years old, which means more than 150 people lived in this room before me. And every person, inevitably, must have filled the room with have been filled with laughter, heartbreaks, gossip, love stories, fights, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
