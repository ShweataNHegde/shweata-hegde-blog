The sun was not fully out in the morning. It suddenly rained in the afternoon. Later, the sun shone bright for a while before the pouring rain hit the ground.\nI took this picture late afternoon before the second rain. Funnily, I had never fully explored this part of the Old NCBS building. They have nice outdoor spaces!\nAs I took the picture, I realised how my time here at the BLiSc campus resembles today\u0026rsquo;s weather. I had a gloomy start, things went downhill, but I pulled myself back up for some sunshine moments, and now it\u0026rsquo;s back to being gloomy again. It\u0026rsquo;s been a wild three months. Living alone, exploring by myself, making and losing acquaintances, pulling together an international trip from scratch, running the podcast, navigating new workspace and tasks, and doing applications. No wonder I feel overwhelmed. But like there is beauty in these rain-soaked flowers facing the somewhat blue sky, there is one in my struggles and successes, too. I\u0026rsquo;ll have to keep chugging along. I\u0026rsquo;m grateful to this place for its lessons.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/blisc-lessons/","summary":"Today\u0026rsquo;s weather was weird.

I have an exam in two hours. But here I am, sitting on my bed facing the same pink curtain and the fairy light, reflecting on my time in Room No. 122. In a week, it won\u0026rsquo;t be mine.\nThe hostel is close to 70-years-old that means more than 150 people must have stayed in this room before me. I can\u0026rsquo;t help but wonder about the different stories the room holds \u0026ndash; stories that I\u0026rsquo;ll never know. Every year, the room must have been filled with laughter, heartbreaks, gossip, love stories and fights. Maybe they made their best memories in this room? Or their worst. Or none.\nI surely have made memories. I\u0026rsquo;ve grown so much as a person. I\u0026rsquo;ve developed this and the indiaaskswhy.org website, planned a major event \u0026ndash; Climate Knowledge Hunt Hackathon, conquered my stage fear thanks to the plans I made sitting on this bed, made new friends and connections, and hosted private concerts for my gals :)\nI also raged in anger when the water in the washroom stopped so many times. The wing has water issues; incoming people stay warned. I\u0026rsquo;ve agonized over studying useless and outdated stuff and pointless assignments.\nBut seriously, 122, thank you for keeping me sheltered while I brewed crazy plans. My gals, I\u0026rsquo;m grateful for bearing with me. I cannot imagine my hostel life without you two \u0026ndash; Kir and Nav.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve lost and found myself multiple times. I lived my life here, and it\u0026rsquo;s time to leave. The room will hit a lull. But that\u0026rsquo;s only until the new kids with wild dreams arrive to revive this pink-walled windowless room.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leave-and-let-live/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m in the middle of the exam season.
