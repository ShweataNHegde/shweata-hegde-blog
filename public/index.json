[{"content":"Week 06 of the YIF. I have been meaning to document learnings since Week 01, but I never found the time. Including a new habit into your schedule takes effort.\n2024-09-02 Made my CV Today, after struggling for many months to perfect my CV, I finished creating one. I was asked by a professor to share my CV so he could look for a potential PhD advisor if I\u0026rsquo;m interested in pursuing one. I used Superset CV builder. Although it was clunky (with edit widget being too small and it taking forever to load), it helped me format my CV and restrict it to a page. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;ve done a good job at describing my work experience. We were asked to use the PAR Framework (Problem-Action-Result), but I got to lazy and copy-pasted details from my older resumes and modified a bit for consistency.\nClasses In our Leadership class, we went over what Mission, Vision, Strategy and Values were. It seemed like the professor had gotten Mission and Vision swapped when he explained. In the later half of the class, we discussed what liberal arts education really meant.\nNotes I took while reading Surely You\u0026rsquo;re Joking book on the side\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t pay much attention to the history class. We were critically examining Rasosundari Devi\u0026rsquo;s autobiography, My Life. We discussed what we can and cannot conclude from it about the lives of women of the time, what an authetic piece of historical document is, what questions to ask before making inferences from such texts, etc.\nReadings [Paper] Many Analysts, One Data Set: Making Transparent How Variations in Analytic Choices Affect Results A well-written paper on crowdsourcing analysis of data. Same data, same research questions and multiple teams. What the researchers who crowdsourced found was that even when everyone uses the same data and make well-meaning defensible decisions on the statistical approach to tackle the question, there is a significant variation in the answers they get.\n[Book] ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/week-06-yif/","summary":"Week 06 of the YIF.

I got selected for the Young India Fellowship (YIF) 2025. Taking a gap year after undergrad was risky, but I\u0026rsquo;m happy that it led me to the YIF. In a month\u0026rsquo;s time, I will be back to being a student. Probably for the first time, my education will be worthy of time and investment. What sold YIF for me is an that it\u0026rsquo;s all-in-one package. I\u0026rsquo;m learning history, economics, statistics, astrophysics, climate, leadership, writing, and many other disciplines and skills. And my peers are fully committed to the Fellowship, it seemed like! During my undergrad, none of us really wanted to learn from our classes. We didn\u0026rsquo;t engage in critical discussions or bother putting any efforts into assignments.\nWhy am I doing YIF? Currently in life, I\u0026rsquo;m lost. Having run IndiaAsksWhy and #semanticClimate with some success, I know it is to sustain projects and make a living out of them. How to get to a stage where I get to make an impact, but I want to get paid decently.\nAnd then, a lot happened over the gap year,\nI grew as a person. I was a free-bird when I graduated undergrad, but now I know I have responsibilities of myself and family. I didn\u0026rsquo;t strike the balance between work and life (hence dealing with sickness now). I was also flooded by failures and rejections, I lost confidence and felt burnt out. I\u0026rsquo;m not hoping for a magic solution from the YIF. But maybe I can connect with people with similar struggles and learn? Figure out what jobs fit me?\nAdvice for Myself These may sound generic, but to keep reminding myself, some advice:\nBe open to new people, ideas, and experiences Speak up Learn, make mistakes, learn Enjoy the fellowship. Be a part of the community Take care of physical and mental health; eat enough food Good luck to myself and all my peers from 2025 batch. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if the YIF lives upto its hype.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/young-india-fellowship/","summary":"Yay! I got selected for the Young India Fellowship (YIF) 2025.

Funnily, I had never fully explored this part of the Old NCBS building. They have nice outdoor spaces!\nAs I took the picture, I realised how my time here at the BLiSc campus resembles today\u0026rsquo;s weather. I had a gloomy start, things went downhill, but I pulled myself back up for some sunshine moments, and now it\u0026rsquo;s back to being gloomy again. It\u0026rsquo;s been a wild three months. Living alone, exploring by myself, making and losing acquaintances, pulling together an international trip from scratch, running the podcast, navigating new workspace and tasks, and doing applications. No wonder I feel overwhelmed. But like there is beauty in these rain-soaked flowers facing the somewhat blue sky, there is one in my struggles and successes, too. I\u0026rsquo;ll have to keep chugging along. I\u0026rsquo;m grateful to this place for its lessons.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/blisc-lessons/","summary":"Today\u0026rsquo;s weather was weird.

Sitting on this bed, I developed my website and indiaaskswhy.org, single-handedly planned a major event (Climate Knowledge Hunt Hackathon Sep. edition), and conquered my stage fear by taking demo classes. I also made new friends and connections and hosted private concerts for my gals :)\nI also raged in anger when the water in the washroom stopped so many times. The wing has water issues; incoming people stay warned. I\u0026rsquo;ve agonized over studying useless and outdated stuff and doing pointless assignments.
