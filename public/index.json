[{"content":"Term 03 officially begins. I am excited for the courses this time. We have Microeconomics and The New Geography in the Information Age (NGIA) \u0026ndash; a funky name but it is a course on information in the age of internet. This week features me singing, reading a lot, working on Chevening Application, spending time with the cohort and having quality time with Karthik.\n2024-10-28 First day of Term 03. We had to back-to-back lectures. Woke up early, made it to class 20 minutes before it started. Prof. A. K. Shivkumar from Harvard is teaching us Microeconomics. I like his lecture-approach, simple whiteobard and marker style. We were acquainted with the basics of microeconomics. The problems of the society \u0026ndash; what to produce, how to produce them, how much. We discussed the need for intervention of the market \u0026ndash; supply-side and demand-side. We ended with with model of economy. In the last half an hour of the class, we looked at the case study: India in numbers.\nModel of Economy\nNGIA was interesting, too. We discussed China\u0026rsquo;s social credit system and surveillance. The course is taught by Prof. Debayan Gupta, it is a bit hard to keep up with him as he throws out ideas and readings. But I can see the course being fun.\nI had Office Hours with Centre for Writing and Communication (CWC) to discuss my application on which I had made decent progress, before going to the concert by Amit Chaudari hosted for the YIF cohort. Later in the day, I myself perfomed at the Broadway-themed open mic. I performed Let It Go from Frozen. I was reminded of countless times my sister and I have sung this song together. It was special to sing this song to an energetic audience.\nI came back, worked on the application and slept late after fixing the argument with Karthik.\n2024-10-29 Another fun Economics lecture. We discussed the Demand Curve.\nIn the afternoon, our ELM team was supposed to have an interview with the India Science Festival folks but they did not turn up to the meeting. I had the Critical Writing class next. We disussed \u0026ldquo;Critical\u0026rdquo; theories and I lost my lecturer half way through.\nI spent the rest of the day on my application.\n2024-10-30 My nose was blocked, which kept me up for the better half of the night. Woke up late. Missed the first ten minutes of NGIA lecture. But the class discussion was great. Our case study was Amazon. We looked their business model, Bezos\u0026rsquo;s vision when he first started the company, and so on. We moved on to talking about ads, user profiling, cookies and so on.\nI had yet another Office Hours with CWC. It has been very useful to think out loud before drafting the essays.\nThe rest of the day was spent lazing around watching Kara and Nate, writing the essays in bits and pieces, and talking to Karthik.\n2024-10-31 \u0026ndash; Start of Deepavali Break The campus felt very empty. In fact, there were only three people on my floor who stayed back on campus for Deepavali. I started my day with the \u0026ldquo;Study in the UK\u0026rdquo; essay. It took quite some time to research about the shortlisted courses and write something concise. I took the afternoon off to join the reading session hosted by the leftover cohort on campus. I read a chapter of the book, \u0026ldquo;Understanding Comics\u0026rdquo;, but spent the majority of the time socialising and listening to stories from people. It was relaxing.\nI came back to room, worked on my essays, watched an episode of Phineas and Ferb with Karthik (we had been meaning to watch it for a year now) and called it a day. I could not sleep for some reason. My body felt itchy and breathing became harder. I probably must have fallen asleep at around 0100.\n2024-11-01 I woke up late as a consequence of the disastrous night. I suspected bed bugs and washed all my clothes and bedding. I read FAST India\u0026rsquo;s SciComm ThinkLab report and STIP. I got introduced to The Very Short Introduction Series by Oxford by one of my peers and spent the afternoon reading the tiny book on Environmental Politics.\nIn the evening, we all got together to celebrate Deepavali. I am so glad one of us took the initiative to do something to mark the day. Although not grand, this was the first time in six years that I was celebrating Deepavali. Still away from home. Maybe next year.\nI finished drafting all the essays and felt very pleased with myself.\n2024-10-02 A regular morning. I read my essays again, made minor changes and finalised the version. In the afternoon, I contacted people asking for feedback. I worked on Critical Writing research project summarising one of the interviews.\nAbi arrived in the evening, welcomed her to room. The evening was spent on the new Very Short Introduction I borrowed from the library: Big Data. Post dinner, I conversed with a Chevening Scholar who gave feedback on my essays. I was happy that she thought most of my essays were great. Boosts confidence. She had several suggestions, I will working on them over the next two days.\n2024-10-03 Brings us to today. Spent the morning reading the tiny book on Big Data. Read about the plight of Warehouse workers (a recommended reading for NGIA) and am now at the library. I will work on the application, the essay due for NGIA, and read.\nReadings [Book] Environmental Politics, A Very Short Introduction [Book] Big Data, A Very Short Introduction [Article] SciComm ThinkLab Report \u0026ndash; outlines the current status of Indian Science Communication [Article] I Was a Warehouse Wage Slave ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/week-14/","summary":"Term 03 officially begins.

Having been deep into Climate Game work, our ELM team took a break from work, so I spent my time on Chevening application. Drafting these essays is hard. Sometimes you feel great looking at your past work summarised, and at other times you feel stuck, doubting yourself.\n2024-10-22 Typical work day. Our ELM team worked remotely? Oh, yes. we did. We discussed the mechanics of the world in detail. One of our team members was leaving home. I spoke to Karan during our meeting and he told me I will not be able to attend SJAI\u0026rsquo;s Science Journalism Conference in full.\nLater in the evening, I went to the lamp making event hosted by the Makerspace. I had a fun time cutting wire, stripping, soldering and connecting the plug. We couldn\u0026rsquo;t get to making the lamp cover though :(.\nThe wire socket I made. The bulb in the box.\n2024-10-23 It finally felt like we made progress. We had a Naamkaran ceronomy for the factions in the game and charted out the game scenarios arc. More details on the Notes page: https://pralay.netlify.app/notes/2024-10-23/.\n2024-10-24 After every productive day, it feels like we need time off. We took the day to come up with game scenarios. I continued working on my Chevening application. I had super helpful Office Hours with Soumya from Centre for Writing and Communication on the application.\nI also got myself two charms :)\nSnitch and black cat\n2024-10-25 We discussed our scenarios. I finally felt like all the basework we had done to build the world was all coming together through scenarios. Check out the scenarios here: https://pralay.netlify.app/notes/2024-10-25/.\nWe were suppposed to go to a student concert, but could not get tickets. Arushi and I ended up watching Matilda together. It\u0026rsquo;s a fun light-hearted movie :)\n2024-10-26 The day started with Office Hours for the Climate Game. We then brainstormed the board game version of it for the upcoming interview with the India Science Festival.\nPost lunch, Arushi and I left for Delhi. It took a lot of internal convincing for me to say yes to going out. We visited the Hello Kitty exhibit and roamed around Connaught Place. I got myself a jacket and I love it! Hanging out with Arushi was fun. I finally know how it feels like to go out with your best friend :)\nCute Hello Kity Dining Set under the staircase\nMe peeping to see the Dining Set\nMe writing a letter\nWe were exhausted by the time we came back. I showered, ate dinner and slept after arguing with Karthik.\n2024-10-27 I woke up late. Got out of my room to attend this super cool sound engineering workshop. I washed my hair and tried working on the Chevening application. I got sidetracked by the STEM Quiz. Our team did miserably. I worked on the application and called it a day.\nI felt a major FOMO missing out on Anoop\u0026rsquo;s (my cousin) wedding. It happened in Mysore, would have made it easily if I were in Karnataka.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/week-13/","summary":"2024-10-21 Woke up early today.

As a result, I was stressed, confused, tired, agititated (fought with Karthik quite a lot). I feel like or even have the time to journal as you can tell. But we have made it through. Here\u0026rsquo;s my attempt at recounting key events from the two weeks.\nAt glance, here was my deadline list. Art Appreciation and Shakespeare combined, I had 5 assignments, a conference presentation (The Tech We Want), meeting with Prof. Vijayraghavan, a scholarship application (I discontinued working on it).\nMy deadline list\nAll of what I did Week 11 2024-10-07 On Monday, we watched Ram-Leela, an adaptation of Romeo-Juliet. For a movie with shooting, Bolywood drama, and so on, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t excepting to be in tears when Ram and Leela die. I gained more depth through the discussion in class, including the politics surrounding the movie and its name, the reason for extravagant set, the references to Romeo-Juliet, and so on. (Wish I had the time to summarise here).\n2024-10-08 We watched another adaptation of Romeo-Juliet, Arshinagar. It was a low-budget movie, with some very funny fight scences. I did not like it. After having a professor who knew everything about comics, I spent the rest of the evening working on the Art Appreciation group assignment. I was a bit disappointed by the team not synergising. All used Generative AI models for creating their content, I felt very lonely in the pursuit of actually trying to understand comics.\n2024-10-09 The Presentation Day Although not sufficient, I had curated enough material about comics to feel confident. It was important I felt prepared; it was first ever presentation to the cohort. The presentation went okay. The professor enjoyed. I sat through couple of presentations; they were interesting. Many were performed-based \u0026ndash; entropy through music, roleplay, and so on.\nLater, we had the Art Exhibition, so many amazing paintings. Our cohort is so talented.\n2024-10-10 We discussed Arshinagar, the movie, in our final Shakespeare class. I spent all my free time working on the Commonwealth Application. I eventually realised I did not have genuine answers to some of the questions. I felt incomptent to even describe why lack science communication is relevant in the present times. I gave up on applying. It was a tough decision, but in retrospect the right decision, because I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have had the time.\n2024-10-11 I spoke to Vijayraghavan. It was not glorious as I thought it would be. Here was the reflection I wrote:\nProf. Vijayraghavan and I set up the agenda for the mentorship sessions: figuring out what my next steps would be to continue working on science communication and open science. Prof. advised me to list science communicators, track their career trajectories, and analyse whether I can emulate their career steps. Similarly, he also suggested researching communication organisations (in general), ThinkTanks, and international grants, that might be interested in science communication. His idea is that I can join the communications team and pursue science communication.\nFor continuing work on open science, Prof. asked me what I wanted to do. Are there organisations I can work for? I discussed that organisations like Wikimedia Foundation, Mozilla, etc. have openings. But they require the employee to also take up managerial or technical work. Prof. suggested I showcase those skills to get the job. I have to be a science communicator and a manager.\nHe said that higher education is an option only if you are rich enough to study abroad. Yes, the degree holds an intrinsic value but its objective is also to extort money.\nAll in all, the call was a reality check. Prof. said that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be chasing exciting ideas and interests. The world will not support me or my interests. I will have to find a way to get someone to sign a cheque. Therefore, I should be thinking about how to fit into organisations, and have a longer-term vision rather than just pursuing interests.\nOver the week, in the Critical Writing classes, we studied Ethnographical practices. We are also assigned a group research project. Our group is studying how YIFs take decisions about spending their time.\n2024-10-12 to 2024-10-14 I spent these three days completely on the final Shakespeare assignment. Our team chose to reimagine Romeo and Juliet for art and science. We personified beaker and brush and through their conversations unravelled the interconnections between arts and sciences. In the short time we had, Arushi made drawings for every scene and we produced a stop-motion animation. For reasons, there was no synergy in the group and the experience wasn not enjoyable.\nOn 14th, I had office hour with a Creative Writiing faculty. She gave useful feedback on my previous scholarship application. There is so much to improve upon for me. I\u0026rsquo;m so glad I chose not to submit the Commonwealth Application, it would have been sub-par.\nOh, and one of the days, I got to know I was selected to attend SJAI conference :)\nWeek 12 2024-10-15 Shakespeare Festival I was blown away by the amazing reimaginations the cohort had produced. From musical, Qawali, poetry, comedy, to queer love, cross-religion marriage, and so much more! However, I did not feel fulfilled with our reimagination. The idea did not materialise the way I would have wanted it to.\nI had no time to relax. I came back and work on the The Tech We Want Summit slides and Art Appreciation final paper.\n2024-10-16 For the paper, not surprisingly, I chose to write about the power of scientific illustrations. I wrote case studies of Jane Richardson\u0026rsquo;s Ribbon Diagrams, David Goodsell\u0026rsquo;s cell landscapes, and Nirupa Rao\u0026rsquo;s tree illustrations. It was fun.\n2024-10-17 From waking up, I worked on making the slides for my presentation at The Tech We Want Summit. I was on the sustainability panel and had to be creative in talking about #semanticClimate from that lens. Peter explained how unsustainable PDFs are as they locks up the knowledge. #semanticClimate, by turning the document semantic, is helping reducing the opportunity cost aned making the knowledge usable. In particular, Peter re-discovered the concept of 5-starification of data and suggested we call our software chain as engine 5-starifying documents. I put together the slides in couple of hours and presented at the conference later that day.\nThe presentation went well. The Summit was well-curated and I listened to all the panels \u0026ndash; the poltiics of open tools, maintainence, and so on.\n2024-10-18 Started with office hours with our ELM supervisor, then spent the morning on our ELM. Later. I went to a higher studies career fair in the afternoon. They weren\u0026rsquo;t useful, but I was mainly there to collect brouchers I\u0026rsquo;ll never read.\nI attended Demo sessions of The Tech We Want, the tools were all super cool.\n2024-10-19 Anniv day Spent the morning and afternoon on the ELM. Later in the evening, we went around sticking posters to get people\u0026rsquo;s attention to fill our climate survey.\nKarthik and I watched \u0026ldquo;Inside Out 2\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;m super glad we spent quality time together. Arushi had gone out and got me a Palmier to eat. The movie wrecked me, but I felt so much at peace after spending time relaxing with Karthik.\nLater in the evening, I spoke to Adrian. I gave him updates about what had happened in the past two weeks (not too different from what I\u0026rsquo;ve written here), we discussed comics, nobel prize, views on AI, and much more. Slept late.\n2024-10-20 Worked till afternoon. Felt like our ELM team had hit a slump. Finally got to journalling. Spoke to Chandrani in the evening. In giving her a gist of the past 3 months, I realised the breadth and depth of work I\u0026rsquo;ve done so far at the YIF. After cutting the call, I went to meet Arushi and Shamant to discuss music. Post dinner, I met Pravin who told me everything about PowerBi and the big data work he does in the social sector related to schooling. He really has inspired me to work on meaninful data problems.\nReading List [Book] Understanding Comics, Scott McCloud [Book] Sequentual Art, Will Einser ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/week-11-and-12/","summary":"Days: 2024-10-07 to 2024-10-20\nFinal two weeks of Term 02, Week 11 and 12, were filled with deadlines.

Prof. Menon only posed questions and kept probing for answers from us. We collectively make sense of the concepts by contributing our understandings. It\u0026rsquo;s very rare for a STEM class to be democratic like that.\nI finally met my program anchor, Sudheer. He tells me that things will fall into place and that I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t worry. I cannot seem to gather enough optimism to believe that. I have been thinking about applying to the Commonwealth Scholarship. I feel like I won\u0026rsquo;t have enough time. Is it worth adding another stress to the existing masala of stresses? I don\u0026rsquo;t even know what to do differently from my previous applications. Maybe I should talk to more people and ask help.\nI slept late again. This time I was speaking to Karthik and got carried away.\n2024-10-01 Morning off after a long time. I spent the morning on the Art Appreciation group project abstract and later figuring out deadlines.\nBack to back classes in the evening. I had fun learning about ethnography. We did a quick observation activity. I went to the library with my team and made notes about the environment and people. Shakespeare class was a little dissapointing. All we spoke about was death and desire and I got bored. My roommate and I had a karaoke night later. A nice distraction. Wish I sang more often.\n2024-10-02 Finally got the time to write updates on this blog and think about what to make for my final presentation. I had a tough conversation with Karthik; brain is a bit messed up.\nThe log is being written on 2024-10-20 i.e., 18 days later\nLater that day, I attended an origami workshop and had my first jam session at Ashoka. We sang Hindustani and Carnatic. I had fun.\nLater that week We read Layla and Majnun and followed it up with a classroom discussion. I remember feeling empathetic towards Majnun, the mad man. It was a really good introduction to Sufi literature.\nAs a part of YIF Mentorship Programme, I wrote an Expression of Interest to have Prof. Vijayraghavan as my mentor. He agreed. I\u0026rsquo;m excited.\nFriday and Saturday, we did some world-building for climate game. We played a game called Civilisation for inspiration.\nSaturday, I submitted the application to Science Journalism Association of India\u0026rsquo;s conference happening in Dec. 2024.\nOn Sunday, I had made my final canvas for my Art Appreciation course. I adapted an Islamic geometric pattern. It was therapeutic to draw circles and lines, and paint the shapes. I almost forgot about the misting while painting and had to run out with incomplete painting. Later, we conducted a comic making hour; we had finalised to work on comics for Art Appreciation group assignment.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/week-10/","summary":"2024-09-30 Thanks to the stage reading sessions, I fully read The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet.

We looked at different art movements \u0026ndash; renaissance to performance art. I performed My Heart Will Go On in the farewell class. I got nervous, yet again. Being around talented people all the time can do that for you.\nI spent the first half of the week writing the Expression of Interest to have Prof. Vijayraghavan as my mentor at the YIF. I have been an advocate for open science since I learnt about it. But in writing to Prof. Vijayraghavan, I collated by scattered thoughts about open science in India to coherent narrative. I collasced my interests in science communication and open science. Prathima Muniyappa, an alum of the YIF, had told me about thinking in first principles. I finally noticed commonality two separate career trajectories of mine.\nMe figuring out the commonality between Open Science and Science Communication\nLater in the week, we had an Alum-in-Residence session. Worrin Muivah, the Alum this time, was such a fun person! He runs something called the STEP Academy in North East India. He said what he took away from the YIF was importance of building genuine relationships with people.\nWhat else happened? AC broke down. I slept at around 0200 one day. That was fun, haha. I attended Startup Ashoka to get a feel for the start-up culture and also talk to people about our ELM. Needless to say, I didn\u0026rsquo;t like it that much. I\u0026rsquo;m just averse to words like venture capital, business model, etc. But I got a nice hoodie, so I\u0026rsquo;m not complaining.\nDuring the weekend, I took interviews as a part of ELM. I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt so much more about games and sustainability initatives that exists already. Talking to as many people early on in the project helps in addressing some obvious but overlooked loopholes in the solution in the initial phase. However, it also confuses you because of conflicting opinions you hear.\nAND, most importantly, I went out to Delhi for the first time. I was supposed to go out with Arushi, but Arjun said he had time. This something I wrote on the Metro:\nBaby\u0026rsquo;s Day Out, Delhi Edition.\nFor the first time in two months, I managed to get out of Ashoka. Every time I tried to make plans, I had to abandon them because of deadlines or health. Finally, the stars aligned today.\nI met a friend of mine, Arjun, for the first time at Hauz Khas. I had my YIF friends to guide me to the metro station, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t hard. I got a bit nervous when I had to wait almost an hour at Hauz Khas metro for my friend to turn up. We went to Naivedyam for lunch. Decent Uttampam and great Chutney. Post lunch, We roamed around Hauz Khas village. We checked out a vintage poster shop, Chumbak, Minisou, and an art gallery. Awkwardness lingered for a while, but we got along well. We learnt more about each other. Spoke a bit about YIF and his work.\nThe experience of going out (minus the meeting part) was disorienting. Everything around me \u0026ndash; the stores, the roads, the people, the train, the station \u0026ndash; seemed familiar. Yet I felt paralysed. I felt like I did not know how to interact with my surroundings. Adding to the feeling was that I was not hearing South Indian languages anymore. Made me feel even more out of place, scared almost. It was like I was re-learning how to be human.\nRandom street in Haus Khas Village\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/week-09/","summary":"Since I\u0026rsquo;m writing the account a week later, it\u0026rsquo;ll be brief.\nWe had the last set of Art Appreciation classes.

I also discovered that social media has changed a lot since I last checked in. I stumbled across a lot of regional \u0026lsquo;content creators\u0026rsquo;. Gone are the days where there was little Indian representation online.\n2024-09-19 Finally went to a class! Art Appreciation. We discussed MC Escher\u0026rsquo;s tessellations, which I found to be fascinating. I remembered Peter talking about Escher\u0026rsquo;s work. Got a book from the library called The Joy of Science (has been a joyful read). Read the book, spoke to Peter and called it a day. It was good to be back to being almost normal.\n2024-09-20 ELM Day 03. Had a refreshing start to the day: read The Joy of Science and wrote to my old mentor Gitanjali Yadav. I have also started to think about my career and thoughts ruminate in the back of my mind.\nLater in the afternoon, the ELM Team, Pralay, met to discuss the insights from our secondary research and prepared for the bi-weekly office hour.\nI went to a Rasberry Pi workshop in the evening hosted by a society at the University. I felt bit out of place amidst the undergrads in the beginning, but I settled in as we went on. We worked with Pico W. We were introduced to various pins on the board and what they do. There was something satisfying in writing a line of code and visually see the LED glowing.\nIn-frame: Pinout sheet, bread board, the OLED screen and code on my laptop to turn on the screen\n2024-09-21 We had the office hour with ELM faculty, which went well.

Naturally, I bumped into more non-kannada-speaking folks than usual, and English became my go-to language. Nothing to fret about. All my life I’ve enjoyed speaking in English. I took pride in being fluent in the language at school and even college. I often said I think in English. I had no issues giving presentations, making points in meetings, or having casual conversations at the workplace.\nBut after a while, I noticed something. When it came to emotions or describing an incident that moved me, English failed. I found myself reaching out to a specific Kannada word, only to not find an English equivalent. I missed speaking in Kannada. Maybe my brain was not thinking in English after all? It seemed like certain Kannada words and emotions were closely tied and imprinted, which English words could never replace.\nInterestingly, I knew only two languages until I went to college (Kannada and English). From friends and roommates, I picked up Tamil. And, somehow, because it was friends from whom I learnt Tamil, the language always offers comfort, warmth and fun whenever I speak it.\nTwo Young India Fellows also offered perspectives, which supplemented my experiences. Unlike my urge to switch to Kannada in certain personal settings, Arushi, who is from Jodhpur, said she has no difficulty expressing herself in Hindi (home language) or English. On the other hand, Sohan, a Bengali who has lived in Gurgaon all his life, shared a feeling similar to my own for Tamil. He remarked, “Hindi is a “Mazedhar” language; a language he loves speaking with friends”.\nIn conclusion, emotions around language seem to be guided by various factors.

We have two interesting courses, Art Appreciation (by Prof. Anunaya Chaubey) and Shakespeare and the World (Prof. Jonathan Gil Harris and Prof. Madhavi Menon).\nDaily Breakdown 2024-09-09 I had an uncomfortable experience during the first Art Appreciation class. Prof. asked to paint a canvas in an hour, give it a title, make note of challenges and display. I made an embarassingly bad painting. I was almost in tears after looking around and seeing amazing art works. I felt even worse because of how I reacted. I wish I was slightly better at dealing with being sucky at something.\nIf you are interested to check out my paitning\nOn the other hand, the Shakespeare lecture was fun. It felt like I was watching a Netflix comedy show. The Prof. is very engaging and theatrical. We spent the first hour discussing the relevance of the course by debunking myth that Shakespeare is English and elite. One common obstacle we face with Shakespeare is his language. We looked at why that\u0026rsquo;s the case, and how one can overcome it.\nLecture notes #01\nAnd, later in the evening, we had an open mic! I finally, after waiting for more than a year, got to perform :) I did a cover version of Love Me Like You Do, by Ellie Goulding. I was very nervous in the beginning, but I felt it leaving me towards the end of my first performance (thanks to the amazing YIF crowd). I had this familiar urge of wanting to perform again. Luckily, a batchmate of mine, had got a guitar and we ended up performing impromptu. A fun night performing and watching other people perfrom as well :)\nFirst peformance at the YIF\n2024-09-10 I woke up tired and hungry. But no choice. Had to get ready because for the 0930 Art Appreciation lecture. In the lecture, we discussed what art is, how we make sense of visual world, and so on. We also explored topics like scopic regime, gestalt. Towards the end of the lecture, we looked at some art work to understand what beauty and aesthetics really mean. In the evening, we had a Discussion Session, where we made sense of each others\u0026rsquo; paintings. It was interesting how none of the people in my group thought it was a \u0026lsquo;bad\u0026rsquo; painting.\nSpent the rest of the day on the ISF proposal.\n2024-09-11 Again, woke up tired and hungry. No choice. Art Appreciation lecture. We looked at does one make sense of art. Based on discussions from past two days, we arrived at: \u0026ldquo;Artwork embodies an Intention, which is experienced by Beholder, who uses sensations, knowledge and emotion to generate an artistic experience.\u0026ldquo;We looked at some case studies: Wind of Sea, Madhubani paintings and Yayomi Kasama\u0026rsquo;s work.\nShakespeare and the World lecture was super exciting. We discussed Ovid\u0026rsquo;s (Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;bro crush\u0026rdquo;) Metamorphoses. First, I was blown away by the insights the class had about the literary work. Professor complimented them to make the conversation complete. I enjoyed it. I\u0026rsquo;m now intrigued by the concept of Metamorphoses \u0026ndash; the chaos, the partition of inseparables by gods and humans, the order, the chaos which follows again, the cycle continues.\nClass Notes\n2024-09-12 Art Appreciation class as usual. We discussed Unifying Classical and Romantic, the reasoning and imagination. In the Critical Writing class, we explored the concept of literacy and distinguished it from literacy rate. We looked at literacy as something which is specific, plural and contextual. Finally, we had our first stage reading of Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s drama. We finished 3 scenes from The Midsummer Night\u0026rsquo;s Dream.\n2024-09-13 First ELM day. Went well. We did some logistical work, brainstormed a bit, called it a day.\nI attended the session on how to approach Masters application. It was one of the most useful sessions on higher studies I\u0026rsquo;ve ever attended.\nI ended up going to a movie called \u0026ldquo;Us\u0026rdquo;. It was my first-ever horror movie. Scenes were disturbing. The movie has a really good political message though.\n2024-09-14 Couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep well. Woke up feeling tired. Feverish towards the afternoon. Chills at night\n2024-09-15 Couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep well. Fever, chills, wisdom tooth ache. Went to the dentist instead of going with the cohort to National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA). Had an interesting conversation with a YIF alum who happened to come along with me in the ambulance to the dentist.

But I also explored how to run them in Python. So, it only makes sense for my final report to be an interactive Python file.\n# Import packages from scipy.stats import norm import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import random import seaborn as sns Part A Choose three of the four following statistical tools (A.1 – A.4). For each of your chosen three, write a short response exhibiting your understanding of the tool (250 words maximum each).\nA.1 Normal Distribution The Bell Curve: The one curve that rules them all!\nBefore we arrive at what a normal distribution is, I\u0026rsquo;d like you to devise an experiment.\nThrow a dice 10 times and note the average. An example outcome would be: [6 5 2 1 5 4 4 5 4 1]. The average is 3.7. Will the averages always remain the same? Would there be a pattern in the averages noted?\nMaybe you\u0026rsquo;d say let\u0026rsquo;s repeat the same process 10000 times. Of course, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t sit and throw dice 100000, would you? You get a computer to do it.\nAs you shall see below, I\u0026rsquo;ve written a few lines of code to simulate a throw of dice. I\u0026rsquo;ve asked it to generate random numbers between 1 and 6 (mimicking throwing a die) 10 times, note the average and repeat 10000 times.\nLooking at 10000 data points would be tedious. Instead, let\u0026rsquo;s visualise. A histogram plot reveals that there most of the average is centred around a number (mean) and it is almost symmetrically spread out. How data is spread is given by standard deviation. This type of distribution is a normal distribution. It is also known as a bell curve, or as the professor likes to call it: \u0026ldquo;The one curve that rules them all!\u0026rdquo;\nrng = np.random.default_rng(seed=2310) rolls = rng.integers(low=1, high=6, endpoint=True, size=(10_000, 10)) sns.histplot(data=rolls.mean(axis=1), binwidth=0.1) plt.show() rolls_sort = np.sort(rolls.mean(axis=1)) rolls_mean = np.average(rolls_sort) rolls_std = np.std(rolls_sort) norm(rolls_mean, rolls_std).cdf(4) 0.8176661208472158 We find normal distributions everywhere. Height and weight distribution in a class, people\u0026rsquo;s shower time, etc. Knowing that their distribution is normal will help you make useful inferences such as z% of data lies between x and y range. For example, 81% of the averages are between 0 and 4.\nStandard Normal Deviation When the mean(μ) is 0 and the standard deviation(σ) is 1, then we call it a \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; normal distribution curve. The area under the curve is 1. The concept of standard deviation is important, we will come to it in the later section.\nrandom_numbers_0_1 = [random.normalvariate(0, 1) for _ in range(1_000_000)] sns.histplot(data=random_numbers_0_1, binwidth=0.1) plt.show() A.2 Sampling Choosing a subset or sample of individuals from a statistical population is called sampling. Why is it important? Well, let\u0026rsquo;s go back to our die example. We were lucky that we could simulate 10000*10 throws. But let\u0026rsquo;s say you are collecting data on a country\u0026rsquo;s opinion on who they think would win the election, or you are a researcher testing whether a drug works and can be deployed to the entire population. Realistically, you get only a subset of the statistical population.\nNow, would the sample be representative of the population? In other words, can you draw inferences from the sample that is true for the entire population?\nTo answer this, let\u0026rsquo;s go back to our dice throws. Out of the 10000 averages, let\u0026rsquo;s get 500 of them at random.\nrandom_500_throw_averages = np.random.choice(rolls.mean(axis=1), 500, replace=False) sorted_500 = np.sort(random_500_throw_averages) plt.plot(sorted_500, norm.pdf(sorted_500, loc=np.average(random_500_throw_averages), scale=np.std(random_500_throw_averages))) [\u0026lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7f440f945db0\u0026gt;] You notice that the random 500 when plotted gives us the familiar bell curve. So, this sample represents the whole population of dice throw averages. However, is this always true?\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll reduce the sample size to 20 and see what happens.\nrandom_20_throw_averages = np.random.choice(rolls.mean(axis=1), 20, replace=False) sorted_20 = np.sort(random_20_throw_averages) plt.plot(sorted_20, norm.pdf(sorted_20, loc=np.average(random_20_throw_averages), scale=np.std(random_20_throw_averages))) [\u0026lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7f440fbd8340\u0026gt;] With 20 throw averages, the characteristic normal curve is gone. One should therefore ensure that their sample size is big enough. There are other aspects to consider, too. Is there a bias in the sample? Maybe during the sample collection, we somehow happened to pick up more outliers giving them a greater representation. The process of sampling itself introduces errors, that need to be accounted for. Therefore, analysing samples to draw inferences should be done meticulously considering aspects such as sample size, bias, error, etc.\nA.4 Randomness As always, we\u0026rsquo;ll go back to our die experiment. Think about a single 10-die throw. The outcome of that set of throws is random. However, we saw that after repeating the throws many many times, it followed a normal distribution. If you know the probability distribution, you can predict the probability of a given random event happening.\nRandomness is an important feature of data sets. For example, we suspected, in Sir Cyril Burt\u0026rsquo;s case, a possible fraud when we inferred that his IQ data were too normal, i.e., not random as one would naturally see. There are many statistical tests one can run like Chi-Square Tests to determine the normalness of data.\nWhat is interesting to note is that in the previous questions so far, we have used a Python module called random, which simulated die throws by providing us with sequences of random numbers between 1 and 6. We also used the same module to pick 500 random die-throw averages to form our sample.\nPart B Write three short responses (150 words maximum each) on three topics of your choosing from the course.\nB.1 What would Polya do? What would Polya do? One of the major learnings from the course has been Polya\u0026rsquo;s approach to problem solving.\nWhile doing the statistics assignments, we routinely ensured we asked the following questions:\nWhat is asked? How to tackle the problem? Oftentimes, we resorted to asking simple yet crucial questions like how many Pronto Pizza deliveries were above the limit of 25 minutes? Solve the problem. This was the fun part. I enjoyed learning about Python packages to perform statistical analysis. Look back and look ahead. While writing reports, we questioned what the inferences meant. We looked back to ask, for example, which days of the week are the deliveries late? This helped us give specific recommendations to the company (looking ahead). Any statistician sitting to analyse data should answer these questions, first.\nB.2 How to calculate the area under the normal curve? In our averages of the die-throw experiment, I made a statement that 81% of the averages were between 0 and 4. How did I get that percentage? I used one of the important features of the normal distribution. The area under the curve gives the probability of a given event.\nHow to calculate the area under the curve? The area under the whole of the standard normal distribution is 1. We scale and shift any normal distribution to standard one and obtain the corresponding area.\nThere is a function called the Cumulative Density Function (CDF), which gives us the probability value for outcomes between a range (0 and 4, for example). A single line of code saved tons of time I would have spent calculating the z-score, looking up the table, etc. Python is convenient if you know how to use it.\nnorm(rolls_mean, rolls_std).cdf(4) 0.8176661208472158 B.3 What is the right \u0026rsquo;n\u0026rsquo; (sample size)? In section A.2, we looked at the importance of sample size. 500 was representative of the die throw averages, whereas 20 wasn\u0026rsquo;t. How do we determine the right sample size? This is, as we alluded previously, an important question. It\u0026rsquo;s problematic if someone performs an opinion poll, and makes inferences not knowing whether their data represents the population. As a science communicator, I read scientific papers and have to make judgements on whether the authors\u0026rsquo; claims are valid. The table is below taken from the lecture on opinion polls. It gives you the sample size estimates needed to make conclusive claims about a population given an error tolerance and confidence.\nHow to read the table? If we tolerate the error of 0.1 (meaning our value is plus or minus 0.1 away from true probability) and confidence of 90the odds estimation to be right 90%, the sample size needed is 68.\nPart C Find a report in the news, in current events, in an area you are fascinated by, that allows for a statistical analysis. What is the report? What question are you trying to answer by analysing the data? What parts of the story are relevant in answering your question? What smaller questions might you ask as stepping-stones? What information do you need to answer these questions? What statistical tools might you use to answer these questions? Note: you need not actually perform the analysis though you can certainly see how far you can push the models if you wish. (500 words maximum.)\nC.1 Crowdsourcing Data Analysis While working on the statistics group assignments, a question kept bugging me. We were all given the same problem statement and dataset. Yet, I\u0026rsquo;m sure our statistical analysis and inferences would be different. Of course, a minority of the groups would have gotten their numbers wrong, made wrong assumptions, etc. But the majority of us would have chosen a statistical tool with a justifiable reason, cleaned data on specific principles, and so on. Can such good-willed choices also lead to differences? The answer is yes.\nA study on crowdsourcing data analysis published in 2017 (Silberzahn et al.) looked into this problem systematically. They got 29 expert teams to analyse the same data set to address the same research question: whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players. The result was unexpected. There was no single conclusive answer to the research question. Quoting the paper, \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;no teams found a negative effect, 9 found no significant relationship, and 20 found a positive effect. If a single team, selected randomly from the present teams, had conducted the study using the same data set, there would have been a 69% probability of a positive estimated effect size and a 31% probability of a null effect.\u0026rdquo;\nThe authors of the study tried to analyse why there was such stark variance in the results. They looked at analysis approaches, analysts\u0026rsquo; beliefs, expertise, etc. Through peer rating and assessment, they found that none of these had an impact on the differences in the results.\nAll this means one thing: when dealing with analyses of complex data, variation is inevitable. This is concerning. If a medical study conducted \u0026ndash; with all good intentions and careful analysis \u0026ndash; claims a drug has a certain efficacy, can we really trust it? Can we ever trust any published statistical analysis at all?\nTo address the problem of inevitable variability in data analysis, the authors of the paper suggest crowdsourcing data analysis is one possible solution. Apart from crowdsourcing, the research community is also publishing reproduction and replication studies to validate a study\u0026rsquo;s claim. Reproduction is an attempt to arrive at comparable results with identical data using computational methods described in a paper. Replication involves generating new data and applying existing methods to achieve comparable results. What should the lone analyst do? In statistics, there are now tools to \u0026lsquo;mimic\u0026rsquo; crowdsourcing, where the analyst tries every different defensible analysis and systematically arrives at an inference. To sum it up, \u0026ldquo;the best defence against subjectivity in science is to expose it\u0026rdquo;.\nComing back to the bugging question of mine. I think it would be an interesting exercise to perform a similar metanalysis as described in the study for our group assignments to quantify the variations in the results of our analysis.\nReference Silberzahn R, Uhlmann EL, Martin DP, et al.

I was asked by a professor to share my CV so he could look for a potential PhD advisor if I\u0026rsquo;m interested in pursuing one. I used Superset CV builder. Although it was clunky (with edit widget being too small and it taking forever to load), it helped me format my CV and restrict it to a page. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;ve done a good job at describing my work experience. We were asked to use the PAR Framework (Problem-Action-Result), but I got to lazy and copy-pasted details from my older resumes and modified a bit for consistency.\nClasses In our Leadership class, we went over what Mission, Vision, Strategy and Values were. It seemed like the professor had gotten Mission and Vision swapped when he explained. In the later half of the class, we discussed what liberal arts education really meant.\nNotes I took while reading Surely You\u0026rsquo;re Joking book on the side\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t pay much attention to the history class. We were critically examining Rasosundari Devi\u0026rsquo;s autobiography, My Life. We discussed what we can and cannot conclude from it about the lives of women of the time, what an authetic piece of historical document is, what questions to ask before making inferences from such texts, etc.\n2024-09-03 (Tuesday) SD Project At the YIF, we work on a project as part of Experiential Learning Module (ELM). As a Fellow, you are expected to work on either an external or self-designed project for 10 months to gain real-world experience. Our team pitched a climate change game last week and Tuesday, we got to know that we had been waitlisted. It was a bit frustrating that they repeated the exact same feedback for which we had responded during the interview.\nWe frantically contacted mentors for the climate game as that was one of the requirements. Karan, the director of the YIF, helped as well. He got us to talk to Prof. Vijayraghavan (whom I had always wanted to talk to when I was at NCBS), and the Professor has agreed to mentor us. It was a quick but useful conversation. Later, we brainstormed to come up with a mock-up interface.\n2024-09-04 (Wednesday) Last history lecture. Professor\u0026rsquo;s story about M.K. Gandhi had me teary-eyed. I rushed to the library to get the last copy of Kamaladevi\u0026rsquo;s s biography before heading to the ELM team-building session. We had fun activities \u0026ndash; answering trick questions and building a cardboard bridge. We then reflected on how we worked as a team.\nLater that day, we met Meghna Agarwala, a professor of Environmental Studies, to discuss the game. It was intense, but some questions she asked like what\u0026rsquo;s the message you\u0026rsquo;d subtlely want to give through the game, who is your audience, etc. really made us think.\n2024-09-05 (Thursday) First, I had an optional DS.

I started off by adding context to the quotes I had picked from Nico Slate\u0026rsquo;s biography on Kamaladevi. Half way through, I had to stop writing in between to learn how to cite with page numbers. A useful skill. The essay really came together in the last half an hour.

I got selected to the Young India Fellowship (YIF) 2025. Taking a gap year after undergrad was risky, but I\u0026rsquo;m happy that it led me to the YIF. In a month\u0026rsquo;s time, I will be back to being a student. Probably for the first time, my education will be worthy of time and investment. What sold YIF for me is an that it\u0026rsquo;s all-in-one package. I\u0026rsquo;m learning history, economics, statistics, astrophysics, climate, leadership, writing, and many other disciplines and skills. And my peers are fully committed to the Fellowship, it seemed like! During my undergrad, none of us really wanted to learn from our classes. We didn\u0026rsquo;t engage in critical discussions or bother putting any efforts into assignments.\nWhy am I doing YIF? Currently in life, I\u0026rsquo;m lost. Having run IndiaAsksWhy and #semanticClimate with some success, I know it is to sustain projects and make a living out of them. How to get to a stage where I get to make an impact, but I want to get paid decently.\nAnd then, a lot happened over the gap year,\nI grew as a person. I was a free-bird when I graduated undergrad, but now I know I have responsibilities of myself and family. I didn\u0026rsquo;t strike the balance between work and life (hence dealing with sickness now). I was also flooded by failures and rejections, I lost confidence and felt burnt out. I\u0026rsquo;m not hoping for a magic solution from the YIF. But maybe I can connect with people with similar struggles and learn? Figure out what jobs fit me?\nAdvice for Myself These may sound generic, but to keep reminding myself, some advice:\nBe open to new people, ideas, and experiences Speak up Learn, make mistakes, learn Enjoy the fellowship. Be a part of the community Take care of physical and mental health; eat enough food Good luck to myself and all my peers from 2025 batch. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if the YIF lives upto its hype.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/young-india-fellowship/","summary":"Yay! I got selected to the Young India Fellowship (YIF) 2025.

The sun was not fully out in the morning. It suddenly rained in the afternoon. Later, the sun shone bright for a while before the pouring rain hit the ground.\nI took this picture late afternoon before the second rain. Funnily, I had never fully explored this part of the Old NCBS building. They have nice outdoor spaces!\nAs I took the picture, I realised how my time here at the BLiSc campus resembles today\u0026rsquo;s weather. I had a gloomy start, things went downhill, but I pulled myself back up for some sunshine moments, and now it\u0026rsquo;s back to being gloomy again. It\u0026rsquo;s been a wild three months. Living alone, exploring by myself, making and losing acquaintances, pulling together an international trip from scratch, running the podcast, navigating new workspace and tasks, and doing applications. No wonder I feel overwhelmed. But like there is beauty in these rain-soaked flowers facing the somewhat blue sky, there is one in my struggles and successes, too. I\u0026rsquo;ll have to keep chugging along. I\u0026rsquo;m grateful to this place for its lessons.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/blisc-lessons/","summary":"Today\u0026rsquo;s weather was weird.

I have an exam in two hours. But here I am, sitting on my bed facing the same pink curtain and the fairy light, reflecting on my time in Room No. 122. In a week, the room won\u0026rsquo;t be mine.\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but wonder about the stories the room holds, stories that I (or anyone who comes next) will never know. The hostel is close to 70 years old, which means more than 150 people lived in this room before me. And every person, inevitably, must have filled the room with have been filled with laughter, heartbreaks, gossip, love stories, fights, and more.\nOf course, I have contributed to the room\u0026rsquo;s collective memory by growing so much as a person. Sitting on this bed, I developed my website and indiaaskswhy.org, single-handedly planned a major event (Climate Knowledge Hunt Hackathon Sep. edition), and conquered my stage fear by taking demo classes. I also made new friends and connections and hosted private concerts for my gals :)\nI also raged in anger when the water in the washroom stopped so many times. The wing has water issues; incoming people stay warned. I\u0026rsquo;ve agonized over studying useless and outdated stuff and doing pointless assignments. But I learnt to be patient.\n122, thank you for keeping me sheltered while I brewed crazy plans. My gals, I\u0026rsquo;m grateful for bearing with me. I cannot imagine my hostel life without you two \u0026ndash; Kir and Nav.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve lost and found myself multiple times. I lived my life here, and it\u0026rsquo;s time to leave. The room will hit a lull now. But not for long. The new kids with wild dreams will soon arrive to revive this pink-walled windowless room (yes, there is one broken window) and add to the room\u0026rsquo;s ever-increasing memory.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leave-and-let-live/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m in the middle of the exam season.
