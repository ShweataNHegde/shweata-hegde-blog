Naturally, I bumped into more non-kannada-speaking folks than usual, and English became my go-to language. Nothing to fret about. All my life I’ve enjoyed speaking in English. I took pride in being fluent in the language at school and even college. I often said I think in English. I had no issues giving presentations, making points in meetings, or having casual conversations at the workplace.\nBut after a while, I noticed something. When it came to emotions or describing an incident that moved me, English failed. I found myself reaching out to a specific Kannada word, only to not find an English equivalent. I missed speaking in Kannada. Maybe my brain was not thinking in English after all? It seemed like certain Kannada words and emotions were closely tied and imprinted, which English words could never replace.\nInterestingly, I knew only two languages until I went to college (Kannada and English). From friends and roommates, I picked up Tamil. And, somehow, because it was friends from whom I learnt Tamil, the language always offers comfort, warmth and fun whenever I speak it.\nTwo Young India Fellows also offered perspectives, which supplemented my experiences. Unlike my urge to switch to Kannada in certain personal settings, Arushi, who is from Jodhpur, said she has no difficulty expressing herself in Hindi (home language) or English. On the other hand, Sohan, a Bengali who has lived in Gurgaon all his life, shared a feeling similar to my own for Tamil. He remarked, “Hindi is a “Mazedhar” language; a language he loves speaking with friends”.\nIn conclusion, emotions around language seem to be guided by various factors. First, the social and cultural environment in which it was learnt from and spoken. Tamil (for me) and Hindi (for Sohan) are fun because we talk to friends in them. Second, the richness of our vocabulary and tight connection between specific words and emotions. I take pride in my English in an academic context, but when explaining emotions I prefer more precise words in Kannada.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/term-01-cw-on-emotions-and-languages-assignment/","summary":"After living in Mysore (a quiet city in Karnataka) for most of my life, I moved to Bengaluru last year for work.

We have two interesting courses, Art Appreciation (by Prof. Anunaya Chaubey) and Shakespeare and the World (Prof. Jonathan Gil Harris and Prof. Madhavi Menon).\nDaily Breakdown 2024-09-09 I had an uncomfortable experience during the first Art Appreciation class. Prof. asked to paint a canvas in an hour, give it a title, make note of challenges and display. I made an embarassingly bad painting. I was almost in tears after looking around and seeing amazing art works. I felt even worse because of how I reacted. I wish I was slightly better at dealing with being sucky at something.\nIf you are interested to check out my paitning\nOn the other hand, the Shakespeare lecture was fun. It felt like I was watching a Netflix comedy show. The Prof. is very engaging and theatrical. We spent the first hour discussing the relevance of the course by debunking myth that Shakespeare is English and elite. One common obstacle we face with Shakespeare is his language. We looked at why that\u0026rsquo;s the case, and how one can overcome it.\nLecture notes #01\nAnd, later in the evening, we had an open mic! I finally, after waiting for more than a year, got to perform :) I did a cover version of Love Me Like You Do, by Ellie Goulding. I was very nervous in the beginning, but I felt it leaving me towards the end of my first performance (thanks to the amazing YIF crowd). I had this familiar urge of wanting to perform again. Luckily, a batchmate of mine, had got a guitar and we ended up performing impromptu. A fun night performing and watching other people perfrom as well :)\nFirst peformance at the YIF\n2024-09-10 I woke up tired and hungry. But no choice. Had to get ready because for the 0930 Art Appreciation lecture. In the lecture, we discussed what art is, how we make sense of visual world, and so on. We also explored topics like scopic regime, gestalt. Towards the end of the lecture, we looked at some art work to understand what beauty and aesthetics really mean. In the evening, we had a Discussion Session, where we made sense of each others\u0026rsquo; paintings. It was interesting how none of the people in my group thought it was a \u0026lsquo;bad\u0026rsquo; painting.\nSpent the rest of the day on the ISF proposal.\n2024-09-11 Again, woke up tired and hungry. No choice. Art Appreciation lecture. We looked at does one make sense of art. Based on discussions from past two days, we arrived at: \u0026ldquo;Artwork embodies an Intention, which is experienced by Beholder, who uses sensations, knowledge and emotion to generate an artistic experience.\u0026ldquo;We looked at some case studies: Wind of Sea, Madhubani paintings and Yayomi Kasama\u0026rsquo;s work.\nShakespeare and the World lecture was super exciting. We discussed Ovid\u0026rsquo;s (Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;bro crush\u0026rdquo;) Metamorphoses. First, I was blown away by the insights the class had about the literary work. Professor complimented them to make the conversation complete. I enjoyed it. I\u0026rsquo;m now intrigued by the concept of Metamorphoses \u0026ndash; the chaos, the partition of inseparables by gods and humans, the order, the chaos which follows again, the cycle continues.\nClass Notes\n2024-09-12 Art Appreciation class as usual. We discussed Unifying Classical and Romantic, the reasoning and imagination. In the Critical Writing class, we explored the concept of literacy and distinguished it from literacy rate. We looked at literacy as something which is specific, plural and contextual. Finally, we had our first stage reading of Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s drama. We finished 3 scenes from The Midsummer Night\u0026rsquo;s Dream.\n2024-09-13 First ELM day. Went well. We did some logistical work, brainstormed a bit, called it a day.\nI attended the session on how to approach Masters application. It was one of the most useful sessions on higher studies I\u0026rsquo;ve ever attended.\nI ended up going to a movie called \u0026ldquo;Us\u0026rdquo;. It was my first-ever horror movie. Scenes were disturbing. The movie has a really good political message though.\n2024-09-14 Couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep well. Woke up feeling tired. Feverish towards the afternoon. Chills at night\n2024-09-15 Couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep well. Fever, chills, wisdom tooth ache. Went to the dentist instead of going with the cohort to National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA). Had an interesting conversation with a YIF alum who happened to come along with me in the ambulance to the dentist.

But I also explored how to run them in Python. So, it only makes sense for my final report to be an interactive Python file.\n# Import packages from scipy.stats import norm import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import random import seaborn as sns Part A Choose three of the four following statistical tools (A.1 – A.4). For each of your chosen three, write a short response exhibiting your understanding of the tool (250 words maximum each).\nA.1 Normal Distribution The Bell Curve: The one curve that rules them all!\nBefore we arrive at what a normal distribution is, I\u0026rsquo;d like you to devise an experiment.\nThrow a dice 10 times and note the average. An example outcome would be: [6 5 2 1 5 4 4 5 4 1]. The average is 3.7. Will the averages always remain the same? Would there be a pattern in the averages noted?\nMaybe you\u0026rsquo;d say let\u0026rsquo;s repeat the same process 10000 times. Of course, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t sit and throw dice 100000, would you? You get a computer to do it.\nAs you shall see below, I\u0026rsquo;ve written a few lines of code to simulate a throw of dice. I\u0026rsquo;ve asked it to generate random numbers between 1 and 6 (mimicking throwing a die) 10 times, note the average and repeat 10000 times.\nLooking at 10000 data points would be tedious. Instead, let\u0026rsquo;s visualise. A histogram plot reveals that there most of the average is centred around a number (mean) and it is almost symmetrically spread out. How data is spread is given by standard deviation. This type of distribution is a normal distribution. It is also known as a bell curve, or as the professor likes to call it: \u0026ldquo;The one curve that rules them all!\u0026rdquo;\nrng = np.random.default_rng(seed=2310) rolls = rng.integers(low=1, high=6, endpoint=True, size=(10_000, 10)) sns.histplot(data=rolls.mean(axis=1), binwidth=0.1) plt.show() rolls_sort = np.sort(rolls.mean(axis=1)) rolls_mean = np.average(rolls_sort) rolls_std = np.std(rolls_sort) norm(rolls_mean, rolls_std).cdf(4) 0.8176661208472158 We find normal distributions everywhere. Height and weight distribution in a class, people\u0026rsquo;s shower time, etc. Knowing that their distribution is normal will help you make useful inferences such as z% of data lies between x and y range. For example, 81% of the averages are between 0 and 4.\nStandard Normal Deviation When the mean(μ) is 0 and the standard deviation(σ) is 1, then we call it a \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; normal distribution curve. The area under the curve is 1. The concept of standard deviation is important, we will come to it in the later section.\nrandom_numbers_0_1 = [random.normalvariate(0, 1) for _ in range(1_000_000)] sns.histplot(data=random_numbers_0_1, binwidth=0.1) plt.show() A.2 Sampling Choosing a subset or sample of individuals from a statistical population is called sampling. Why is it important? Well, let\u0026rsquo;s go back to our die example. We were lucky that we could simulate 10000*10 throws. But let\u0026rsquo;s say you are collecting data on a country\u0026rsquo;s opinion on who they think would win the election, or you are a researcher testing whether a drug works and can be deployed to the entire population. Realistically, you get only a subset of the statistical population.\nNow, would the sample be representative of the population? In other words, can you draw inferences from the sample that is true for the entire population?\nTo answer this, let\u0026rsquo;s go back to our dice throws. Out of the 10000 averages, let\u0026rsquo;s get 500 of them at random.\nrandom_500_throw_averages = np.random.choice(rolls.mean(axis=1), 500, replace=False) sorted_500 = np.sort(random_500_throw_averages) plt.plot(sorted_500, norm.pdf(sorted_500, loc=np.average(random_500_throw_averages), scale=np.std(random_500_throw_averages))) [\u0026lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7f440f945db0\u0026gt;] You notice that the random 500 when plotted gives us the familiar bell curve. So, this sample represents the whole population of dice throw averages. However, is this always true?\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll reduce the sample size to 20 and see what happens.\nrandom_20_throw_averages = np.random.choice(rolls.mean(axis=1), 20, replace=False) sorted_20 = np.sort(random_20_throw_averages) plt.plot(sorted_20, norm.pdf(sorted_20, loc=np.average(random_20_throw_averages), scale=np.std(random_20_throw_averages))) [\u0026lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7f440fbd8340\u0026gt;] With 20 throw averages, the characteristic normal curve is gone. One should therefore ensure that their sample size is big enough. There are other aspects to consider, too. Is there a bias in the sample? Maybe during the sample collection, we somehow happened to pick up more outliers giving them a greater representation. The process of sampling itself introduces errors, that need to be accounted for. Therefore, analysing samples to draw inferences should be done meticulously considering aspects such as sample size, bias, error, etc.\nA.4 Randomness As always, we\u0026rsquo;ll go back to our die experiment. Think about a single 10-die throw. The outcome of that set of throws is random. However, we saw that after repeating the throws many many times, it followed a normal distribution. If you know the probability distribution, you can predict the probability of a given random event happening.\nRandomness is an important feature of data sets. For example, we suspected, in Sir Cyril Burt\u0026rsquo;s case, a possible fraud when we inferred that his IQ data were too normal, i.e., not random as one would naturally see. There are many statistical tests one can run like Chi-Square Tests to determine the normalness of data.\nWhat is interesting to note is that in the previous questions so far, we have used a Python module called random, which simulated die throws by providing us with sequences of random numbers between 1 and 6. We also used the same module to pick 500 random die-throw averages to form our sample.\nPart B Write three short responses (150 words maximum each) on three topics of your choosing from the course.\nB.1 What would Polya do? What would Polya do? One of the major learnings from the course has been Polya\u0026rsquo;s approach to problem solving.\nWhile doing the statistics assignments, we routinely ensured we asked the following questions:\nWhat is asked? How to tackle the problem? Oftentimes, we resorted to asking simple yet crucial questions like how many Pronto Pizza deliveries were above the limit of 25 minutes? Solve the problem. This was the fun part. I enjoyed learning about Python packages to perform statistical analysis. Look back and look ahead. While writing reports, we questioned what the inferences meant. We looked back to ask, for example, which days of the week are the deliveries late? This helped us give specific recommendations to the company (looking ahead). Any statistician sitting to analyse data should answer these questions, first.\nB.2 How to calculate the area under the normal curve? In our averages of the die-throw experiment, I made a statement that 81% of the averages were between 0 and 4. How did I get that percentage? I used one of the important features of the normal distribution. The area under the curve gives the probability of a given event.\nHow to calculate the area under the curve? The area under the whole of the standard normal distribution is 1. We scale and shift any normal distribution to standard one and obtain the corresponding area.\nThere is a function called the Cumulative Density Function (CDF), which gives us the probability value for outcomes between a range (0 and 4, for example). A single line of code saved tons of time I would have spent calculating the z-score, looking up the table, etc. Python is convenient if you know how to use it.\nnorm(rolls_mean, rolls_std).cdf(4) 0.8176661208472158 B.3 What is the right \u0026rsquo;n\u0026rsquo; (sample size)? In section A.2, we looked at the importance of sample size. 500 was representative of the die throw averages, whereas 20 wasn\u0026rsquo;t. How do we determine the right sample size? This is, as we alluded previously, an important question. It\u0026rsquo;s problematic if someone performs an opinion poll, and makes inferences not knowing whether their data represents the population. As a science communicator, I read scientific papers and have to make judgements on whether the authors\u0026rsquo; claims are valid. The table is below taken from the lecture on opinion polls. It gives you the sample size estimates needed to make conclusive claims about a population given an error tolerance and confidence.\nHow to read the table? If we tolerate the error of 0.1 (meaning our value is plus or minus 0.1 away from true probability) and confidence of 90the odds estimation to be right 90%, the sample size needed is 68.\nPart C Find a report in the news, in current events, in an area you are fascinated by, that allows for a statistical analysis. What is the report? What question are you trying to answer by analysing the data? What parts of the story are relevant in answering your question? What smaller questions might you ask as stepping-stones? What information do you need to answer these questions? What statistical tools might you use to answer these questions? Note: you need not actually perform the analysis though you can certainly see how far you can push the models if you wish. (500 words maximum.)\nC.1 Crowdsourcing Data Analysis While working on the statistics group assignments, a question kept bugging me. We were all given the same problem statement and dataset. Yet, I\u0026rsquo;m sure our statistical analysis and inferences would be different. Of course, a minority of the groups would have gotten their numbers wrong, made wrong assumptions, etc. But the majority of us would have chosen a statistical tool with a justifiable reason, cleaned data on specific principles, and so on. Can such good-willed choices also lead to differences? The answer is yes.\nA study on crowdsourcing data analysis published in 2017 (Silberzahn et al.) looked into this problem systematically. They got 29 expert teams to analyse the same data set to address the same research question: whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players. The result was unexpected. There was no single conclusive answer to the research question. Quoting the paper, \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;no teams found a negative effect, 9 found no significant relationship, and 20 found a positive effect. If a single team, selected randomly from the present teams, had conducted the study using the same data set, there would have been a 69% probability of a positive estimated effect size and a 31% probability of a null effect.\u0026rdquo;\nThe authors of the study tried to analyse why there was such stark variance in the results. They looked at analysis approaches, analysts\u0026rsquo; beliefs, expertise, etc. Through peer rating and assessment, they found that none of these had an impact on the differences in the results.\nAll this means one thing: when dealing with analyses of complex data, variation is inevitable. This is concerning. If a medical study conducted \u0026ndash; with all good intentions and careful analysis \u0026ndash; claims a drug has a certain efficacy, can we really trust it? Can we ever trust any published statistical analysis at all?\nTo address the problem of inevitable variability in data analysis, the authors of the paper suggest crowdsourcing data analysis is one possible solution. Apart from crowdsourcing, the research community is also publishing reproduction and replication studies to validate a study\u0026rsquo;s claim. Reproduction is an attempt to arrive at comparable results with identical data using computational methods described in a paper. Replication involves generating new data and applying existing methods to achieve comparable results. What should the lone analyst do? In statistics, there are now tools to \u0026lsquo;mimic\u0026rsquo; crowdsourcing, where the analyst tries every different defensible analysis and systematically arrives at an inference. To sum it up, \u0026ldquo;the best defence against subjectivity in science is to expose it\u0026rdquo;.\nComing back to the bugging question of mine. I think it would be an interesting exercise to perform a similar metanalysis as described in the study for our group assignments to quantify the variations in the results of our analysis.\nReference Silberzahn R, Uhlmann EL, Martin DP, et al. Many Analysts, One Data Set: Making Transparent How Variations in Analytic Choices Affect Results.

I was asked by a professor to share my CV so he could look for a potential PhD advisor if I\u0026rsquo;m interested in pursuing one. I used Superset CV builder. Although it was clunky (with edit widget being too small and it taking forever to load), it helped me format my CV and restrict it to a page. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;ve done a good job at describing my work experience. We were asked to use the PAR Framework (Problem-Action-Result), but I got to lazy and copy-pasted details from my older resumes and modified a bit for consistency.\nClasses In our Leadership class, we went over what Mission, Vision, Strategy and Values were. It seemed like the professor had gotten Mission and Vision swapped when he explained. In the later half of the class, we discussed what liberal arts education really meant.\nNotes I took while reading Surely You\u0026rsquo;re Joking book on the side\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t pay much attention to the history class. We were critically examining Rasosundari Devi\u0026rsquo;s autobiography, My Life. We discussed what we can and cannot conclude from it about the lives of women of the time, what an authetic piece of historical document is, what questions to ask before making inferences from such texts, etc.\n2024-09-03 (Tuesday) SD Project At the YIF, we work on a project as part of Experiential Learning Module (ELM). As a Fellow, you are expected to work on either an external or self-designed project for 10 months to gain real-world experience. Our team pitched a climate change game last week and Tuesday, we got to know that we had been waitlisted. It was a bit frustrating that they repeated the exact same feedback for which we had responded during the interview.\nWe frantically contacted mentors for the climate game as that was one of the requirements. Karan, the director of the YIF, helped as well. He got us to talk to Prof. Vijayraghavan (whom I had always wanted to talk to when I was at NCBS), and the Professor has agreed to mentor us. It was a quick but useful conversation. Later, we brainstormed to come up with a mock-up interface.\n2024-09-04 (Wednesday) Last history lecture. Professor\u0026rsquo;s story about M.K. Gandhi had me teary-eyed. I rushed to the library to get the last copy of Kamaladevi\u0026rsquo;s s biography before heading to the ELM team-building session. We had fun activities \u0026ndash; answering trick questions and building a cardboard bridge. We then reflected on how we worked as a team.\nLater that day, we met Meghna Agarwala, a professor of Environmental Studies, to discuss the game. It was intense, but some questions she asked like what\u0026rsquo;s the message you\u0026rsquo;d subtlely want to give through the game, who is your audience, etc. really made us think.\n2024-09-05 (Thursday) First, I had an optional DS.

I started off by adding context to the quotes I had picked from Nico Slate\u0026rsquo;s biography on Kamaladevi. Half way through, I had to stop writing in between to learn how to cite with page numbers. A useful skill. The essay really came together in the last half an hour. I\u0026rsquo;m happy I managed to make all the arguments although not in the grandier fashion I had imagined in my brain.\nRelaxed for the rest of the day.\nCheck out my history assignment here\nWeek in Summary Phew, had a lot of ups and downs this week. I\u0026rsquo;m proud of how my assignments turned out. I\u0026rsquo;m super pumped that our SD got accepted and that I\u0026rsquo;ll get to interact with Prof. Vijayraghavan more.\nReadings [Paper] Many Analysts, One Data Set: Making Transparent How Variations in Analytic Choices Affect Results A well-written paper on crowdsourcing analysis of data. Same data, same research questions and multiple teams. What the researchers who crowdsourced found was that even when everyone uses the same data and make well-meaning defensible decisions on the statistical approach to tackle the question, there is a significant variation in the answers they get.\n[Book] Surely You\u0026rsquo;re Joking, Mr. Feynman Light read so far. Feynman is incredibly smart and he doesn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate one bit to show it off. I also didn\u0026rsquo;t know Feynman did biology for a year.\n[Book] Kamaladevi Chattopadhya: The Art of Freedom I had liked Kamaladevi during Prof. Mukherjee\u0026rsquo;s lectures, but I have newly found appreciation for her after reading parts of Nico Slate\u0026rsquo;s biography of her. I wish I was better at articulating, but I love how badass she is. The book opens with this scene of her building city, which comes to be called Faridabad, for migrants right after independence. She goes abroad when she was 18. She does drama, theatre, activism, travel, writing, crafts, everything. She rebels, breaks norms. She boldy imagines new India, where there is no caste, class and gender inequality, where everyone is able to experience the beauty of art.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/week-06-yif/","summary":"Week 06 of the YIF.

I got selected to the Young India Fellowship (YIF) 2025. Taking a gap year after undergrad was risky, but I\u0026rsquo;m happy that it led me to the YIF. In a month\u0026rsquo;s time, I will be back to being a student. Probably for the first time, my education will be worthy of time and investment. What sold YIF for me is an that it\u0026rsquo;s all-in-one package. I\u0026rsquo;m learning history, economics, statistics, astrophysics, climate, leadership, writing, and many other disciplines and skills. And my peers are fully committed to the Fellowship, it seemed like! During my undergrad, none of us really wanted to learn from our classes. We didn\u0026rsquo;t engage in critical discussions or bother putting any efforts into assignments.\nWhy am I doing YIF? Currently in life, I\u0026rsquo;m lost. Having run IndiaAsksWhy and #semanticClimate with some success, I know it is to sustain projects and make a living out of them. How to get to a stage where I get to make an impact, but I want to get paid decently.\nAnd then, a lot happened over the gap year,\nI grew as a person. I was a free-bird when I graduated undergrad, but now I know I have responsibilities of myself and family. I didn\u0026rsquo;t strike the balance between work and life (hence dealing with sickness now). I was also flooded by failures and rejections, I lost confidence and felt burnt out. I\u0026rsquo;m not hoping for a magic solution from the YIF. But maybe I can connect with people with similar struggles and learn? Figure out what jobs fit me?\nAdvice for Myself These may sound generic, but to keep reminding myself, some advice:\nBe open to new people, ideas, and experiences Speak up Learn, make mistakes, learn Enjoy the fellowship. Be a part of the community Take care of physical and mental health; eat enough food Good luck to myself and all my peers from 2025 batch. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if the YIF lives upto its hype.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/young-india-fellowship/","summary":"Yay! I got selected to the Young India Fellowship (YIF) 2025.

I had a gloomy start, things went downhill, but I pulled myself back up for some sunshine moments, and now it\u0026rsquo;s back to being gloomy again. It\u0026rsquo;s been a wild three months. Living alone, exploring by myself, making and losing acquaintances, pulling together an international trip from scratch, running the podcast, navigating new workspace and tasks, and doing applications. No wonder I feel overwhelmed. But like there is beauty in these rain-soaked flowers facing the somewhat blue sky, there is one in my struggles and successes, too.
