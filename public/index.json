Design thinking was a pain to get through; I don\u0026rsquo;t think I learnt anything meaningful from the process. Language course was probably my favourite.

However, we only have two elective courses. It is not loaded as compared to all the other terms. The first elective, Universe and Us, has been super fun. I feel like I am living my high school dream studying astronomy from world experts. Whenever I am in class, I reminisce the awe I felt for science watching VSauce and Veritasium videos.

However, abstracting our way out from this detailed perspective and instead looking at the Welfare State as a whole, we realise that “the welfare state is a distinctive form of governmentality: a specific mode of constituting the economy, assuring social security, and guaranteeing social provision (Garland, D., 2014)”. In this essay, I argue that scientific temperament should be one of the core pillars—if not the pillar—of this form of governmentality.\nScientific Temperament: How Does It Interact With the Welfare State? A term embedded in Indian discourse on science and science popularisation, scientific temperament was first used by Jawaharlal Nehru in The Discovery of India in 1946. Nehru writes,\n“The applications of science are inevitable and unavoidable for all countries and peoples today. But something more than its application is necessary. It is the scientific approach, the adventurous and yet critical temper of science, the search for truth and new knowledge, the refusal to accept anything without testing and trial, the capacity to change previous conclusions in the face of new evidence, the reliance on observed fact and not on pre-conceived theory, the hard discipline of the mind — all this is necessary, not merely for the application of science but for life itself and the solution of its many problems…(Jawaharlal Nehru, 1946, p.512)”\nFurthermore, Kankaria argues that ‘scientific’ in Nehru’s scientific temperament is:\n“akin to a mathematical function that operates on input variables in order to yield specific outputs. The input variable here is active citizen participation in knowledge-building, which can then lead to the output of an independent, postcolonial state that is freed from the shackles of dogmatic views, superstitions and pseudoscience (Kankaria, S., \u0026amp; Chakraborty, A., 2024).”\nScientific temper is now added to the Indian Constitution in 1976 under Article 51A(h), which declares developing of the scientific temper, humanism and spirit of inquiry and reforms as one of the ten fundamental duties of every citizen (Kankaria, S., \u0026amp; Chakraborty, A., 2024). At this stage, it is also important to note that this “broader national, social and humanistic context” (Kankaria, S., \u0026amp; Chakraborty, A., 2024) to scientific temperament framed in the Constituion consciously avoides the scientistic framings sometimes found in STEM rhetoric.\nA State where its “citizens actively participate in gaining both scientific temper and knowledge and its institutions actively promote this process (Kankaria, S., \u0026amp; Chakraborty, A., 2024)”, enables building of two crucial actors for its welfare state: Scientifically conscious and sceptical citizen communities.\nScientifically literate policymakers and care workers I argue that these two actors working in tandem build a welfare state which constantly betters itself through an iterative process of questioning and improving.\nScientifcally Conscious and Sceptical Citizen Communities Scientifically conscious citizens, as mentioned before, are actively participating in gaining scientific temper and knowledge. I envision them as critical thinkers who do not simply benefit from welfare schemes, but actively attempt to question and learn about them. Most importantly, they integrate the scientific knowledge with that of their lived experiences and knowledge. For example, when the government of India launched Digital India initiative—with the vision to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy (About Us—Digital India)—critical questions that a scientifically conscious citizen would ask include:\nWhat problem is Digital India solving? What are the potential problems that Digital India might inturn bring? hom does the initiative benefit? Are the majority of citizens digitally literate to transition? If not, how should one bring about digital literacy? When questions like these become part of the everyday, the collective consciousness (and unconsciousness) of citizens is more critical, leading to greater accountability by the government and even co-creation of welfare schemes. However, an ideal scientifically conscious citizen is a rarity. India poses unique challenges in terms of diversity in religious beliefs, ideologies, leading to prevalance of misinformation, pseudoscientific claims, and conspiracy theories. The lack of scepticism negatively impacts welfare state as one can easily fall for false claims. For instance, recently, a scam advertising a fictitious government job to entrap potential victims was reported (Sharma, 2025). A non-sceptical citizen easily gets lured by such traps.\nPeople’s Science Movement In order to build a State with scientifically conscious citizens, momentum needs to be built starting from the grassroots. Since 1960s, “the People’s Science Movement has worked to democratise the generation of knowledge and its dissemination and integration in Indian society, centring the sociocultural consciousness of the Indian people (How the People’s Science Movement Is Bringing Joy and Equality to Education in Karnataka, India, 2024)”. Given the neolibearal forces reducing science education to producing cheap technical labour forces, People’s Science Movement is a ground-up initative set up by teachers, science experts and blue collar workers to instill critical thinking and scientific temperament in government school students and wider public. They host several nationwide programmes such as Joy of Learning (1994), Cosmic Voyage (1995), People’s Reading movement — Jan Vachan Andolan (1995), International Year of Astronomy (2009), Surya Utsav (Solar eclipse festival) (2019) to a communicate aspects of modern science in an easy to understand manner. Intersecting more closer with the welfare state, People’s Science Movement in Kerala helped stop the construction of hydroelectric dams in Silent Valley of Kerala. Similarly, People’s Science Movmeent has played a crucial role in communicating the short-term and long-term risks of Bhopal Gas Tragdy. More recently, they worked on helping farmers unwrap the complexities of Genetically Modified Crops in resisting companies like Monsanto investing in pesticide resistant GM-crops, as pests (a biological being) can always evolve to counter the resistant crops (T. V., 2020).\nMovements such as these, also help indirectly in building Relational State Capacity as it boosts and strengthens everyday interactions of citizens with agents of the State. However, such movements are at a threat as the State is being shaped by neoliberal forces. As mentioned by T.V., critical sectors like health, education, and social welfare as part of its neo-liberal agenda are increasingly being left to ‘corporate social responsibility’ and “people’s Science Movements are finding it difficult to appeal to the moral economy to entitle and empower impoverished people (T. V., 2020).”\nWhat A Scientifically Conscious Citizen Can Do? A more positive example of a citizen critically questioning the welfare state is that of a YouTube creator called Bengawalk. The author has called out several of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) project including the Metro infrastructure and the never-ending road construction in the city. In the video on the road construction in Banglore, he digs up the Final Feasibility Report, which has proposals for 20 road construction projects. He points out that this report (on which BBMP spent 5 crores) has no budget allocated to make pedestrian infrastructure or to enhance public transport.\nFig. Still from the video on road constructions in Banglore\nLater in the video, the author touches upon the root cause of this road problem: the lack of elected municipal council for many years. Worse, the executive bodies are numerous but do not function complementarily leading to unresolved conflicts on policies. With no body making policies for the benefit of people, who is to stop polling of crores of money going to illogical and unscientific development of cities, which benefits the rich few at the very most?\nAll citizens must be empowered to ask such questions to the State like Bengawalk. However, citizens can develop an agency only if policymakers—who are on the other side of the equation—are also equally scientfically literate (and exist in the first place).\nScientifically Literate Policymakers Going back to one of the earliest welfare states, the U.K., we can see that Beveridge’s and Chadwick’s reports were very much grounded in the latest science of their present. For example, although incorrect, the miasma theory had an influence on health policies and the eventual birth of National Health service in the post-war Britian. Sadly, we do not find the same kind of engagement with science and research by politicians and bureaucrats in India anymore. For example, during the pandemic, instead of building good public health infrastrucutre, our prime minister diverted the public’s attention and asked the citizens to bang plates in gratitude towards the healthcare workers. How can citizens exercise scientific temperament if the top leaders spread false information and claims? And it is these very political leaders who continue to constrain funds for research and development. India spends only 0.6-0.7% of its GDP on Gross Expenditure on Research and Development (GERD). This leads to further decrease in scientific knowledge and temperament of the country.\nHowever, one must also be cautions about what science claims the policymakers choose to believe in. Take Beveridge’s association with Eugenics society. There is always a danger for an unscientific conclusion to almost sound “scientific”. And this is where the partnership between the citizens and policymakers comes into foreground. Through working in tandem, both actors can keep each other accountable, build relational state capacity, and prevent the derailing of ideas and policies.\nConclusion Fig. Relationship between Scientific Temperament and Welfare State\nIf policy makers are scientifically literate and informed, the welfare state governmentality would be based on evidence and knowledge created by scientific method. On the other hand, a scientifically conscious and sceptical citizens would not only benefit from welfare state, but can co-create the welfare state. In a utopian society that is scientifically tempered (in accordance with Nehru’s vision), I see a welfare state that has a healthy balance of scepticism, social security and vision for economic development. I hope the said utopia becomes a reality.\nReferences About Us—Digital India | Leading the transformation in India for ease of living and digital economy | MeitY, Government of India. (n.d.).

After all, my tasks were that of “pure science” like running experiments in labs. However, as years passed, I started having a more outward look, beyond the lab, and realised that science happens not in isolation. The very establishment where I perform experiments is shaped by societal context, and most importantly, local, national and global politics. For instance, if the funding agencies decided to cut funding to my institution, I would not have the chemicals to perform experiments.\nIn fact, fund cuts are a reality now. Recently in January 2025, the U.S. President Donald Trump put in place a 90-day freeze on foreign assistance under the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Although only 0.2% of USAID’s funds were flowing into India, the freeze has resulted in suspension of projects related to health (including HIV/AIDS, TB, maternal and child health, and immunisation programmes), economy, energy, water supply and sanitation, and environmental health. Many researchers involved in these projects might soon lose their jobs. If science policies are critical in shaping the lives of us, academic students and researchers, why is it not part of mainstream discussions in formal educational spaces?\nScience policy discourses are more important than ever in India since funding constraints science. India spends only 0.6-0.7% of its GDP on Gross Expenditure on Research and Development (GERD). Significant proportions of the funding pours in from the private sector and, lately, through bilateral and multilateral agreements with countries and organizations like the European Union, UKRI (United Kingdom Research and Innovation), BRICS, and others. Central Government and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) take up 50% of the expenditure, whereas, the State Governments get a mere 6.7%. However, most of India’s researchers are in these state government institutions. Therefore, researchers, specifically from state universities, are disadvantaged since neither do they get fundings from the government nor are they internationally collaborating. Since Science and Technology is increasingly seen as “soft power” by many countries, researchers—in order to secure independent funding through collaborative programmes—must be aware of the vested interest of the countries involved in bilateral and multilateral agreements. More importantly, in order for India to become an emergent leader in science, academia should exert force on the government to increase its expenditure on Research and Development.\nFinally, as mentioned before, science does not happen in isolation. Scientifc conclusions often have the potential to inform policies that impact the public. Therefore, as researchers, we must think of ourselves as either ‘Science Arbiters’ (who seek to engage and answer factual questions and queries) or ‘Honest Broker of Policy Alternatives’ (who aims to provide an impartial overview of all scientifically legitimate policy alternatives, strengths and weaknesses and their tolerances and uncertainties). Specifically, scientists in India, working on global issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and other environmental issues need to be given greater agency to communicate their findings to influence foreign policies, which might affect our country. A study from 2011 found that Europe and North America dominate participation in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (73%). 45% of countries have never contributed as authors in the IPCC process.\nTherefore, in order to understand the impact of science policies on our research and infleunce them, scientists must be a critical observer of the discourse. Questions about policy—both local and global— should be discussed such as: What are the major science policies in India? What are the internal and external politics shaping them? What does the removal of the DEI policy in the U.S. or its withdrawal from WHO mean to research and development and public health in India? Were these policy decisions made in consultation with scientists? How are climate deals impacting India’s research system? How can research in our labs contribute to policy-making? Science policy 101 must be part of the science education curriculum. At the very least, the discourse around science policies should be given more space and time in classrooms and labs. There is a close interlinkage between science and politics—science we do shapes the foreign policies, and the policies shape the science we do. Science is an individual pursuit, yes, but it is also international and collaborative.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-06-foreign-policy-op-ed-01/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAs a student of science and education at a government college, I had no encouragement to keep up with current affairs.

In 2021, two Asiatic Bear cubs were found on the Pakistani side of Kashmir. Unable to open their eyes, the cubs could barely manage to crawl away from the border. Their mother? She was never to be found on the Pakistani side; she was probably killed at the Indian border, either due to the fencing or landmines. The long-standing disputes between India and Pakistan have led to the two countries taking extreme measures; the electric fence being one of them. The fencing of the Line Of Control (LoC) completed in 2004 was meant to prevent the illegal entry of militants. But it has inadvertently also caused incredible damage to habitats at the border—spanning cold deserts, mountains and hot deserts. Locals and forest officials on both sides of the border recount countless stories of lost wildlife—such as separated cubs, deer injured by landmines, or leopards killed for human safety—all as a direct consequence of border control and fencing. But who is to listen? Both countries are too busy strategising their next wars or attacks.\nAsiatic Bears are one of many threatened border species. Recent data indicates that 82% of global border hotspots for threatened transboundary species are located in Asia. With the global biodiversity loss rate being 100 times greater than the baseline, I believe that it is high time that India and Pakistan—two Asian countries with moderately high transboundary biodiversity—collaborate and initiate dialogue for this pressing need for conservation. However, a study determining the feasibility of the conservation of these species, published in Nature Ecology and Evolution, gave the India-Pakistan border a low feasibility score. The border scored lower in collaboration and shared governance between the two countries, and higher on human pressure due to ongoing conflicts and war activities. With over three wars fought between the two countries in the 77 years of their existence, the India-Pakistan border is one of the most militarized zones in the world. Conflicts and attacks have long neglected biodiversity, leading to habitat fragmentation (particularly for territorial animals), disrupted migration, destruction of habitats, and even inadvertent killings of animals. Furthermore, the lack of research and conservation activities in these regions only exacerbates the problem at hand, as the lack of data de-incentivises the countries from taking action. While attempting to find research on prior conservation activities, I was disappointed by this research gap. A researcher studying Markhor (Pakistan’s national animal) on the Indian side of Kashmir in an interview with a Turkish public broadcaster said “Most of the time security might [ask] you, ‘why are you contacting these people [in Pakistan]?’. Initially, the situation there [in Jammu and Kashmir] was so bad that I was sort of afraid to contact people from Pakistan.” This distrust between the officials and people further threatens the endangered species.\nHow have other Asian countries handled conservational efforts at their borders? Going back to the feasibility index study, we find a positive example of cooperation leading to better conservation. One of the richest biodiversity hotspots, the island of Bruneo, occupied by Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei, has managed to preserve the interiors of the island through legally binding government commitments. One could argue that these three countries have been generally cordial to each other making it easier to collaborate. However, are there examples of countries collaborating on biodiversity conservation despite a history of disputes?\nThe Demilitarised Zone between the two Koreas is an extreme example, where fear inadvertently has led to conservation. A narrow strip at the borders, 4 kilometres wide and 250 kilometres across, with very minimal human inhabitants for the past 70 years, has become a biodiversity-rich region in Korea. Estimates by South Korea suggest that the region is home to more than 5000 species including 100 that are protected. However, the region is still fenced and guarded. Paradoxically, the only reason why the Demilitarized zone is not yet exploited is the fear of war and conflicts rather than peace declarations. Beyond Asia, in conflicted areas such as Israel and Palestine, researchers are trying to collaborate to minimise the effects of war on biodiversity. Recently this March, as reported by Nature, researchers from Israel and Palestine came together to study the potential for barn owls to reduce pesticide use in agriculture, after the ceasefire was declared.\nGiven the urgency biodiversity loss—accelerated further by climate change, pollution and other challenges—it is crucial for Pakistan and India to come together to address the issue. I propose that the two countries take these three crucial steps, taking into consideration the existing differences: define peace parks at the boundaries, continue ceasefires, and exercise empathy. Peace Parks are “a clearly defined geographical space that consists of protected areas that are ecologically connected across one or more international boundaries and involve some form of cooperation”. Researchers\u0026rsquo; top recommendation for this is Siachen (mountain glacier region in the Himalayas) which is home to snow leopards and a place where tributaries of Indus merge. Siachen Peace Park would help conserve snow leopards while preventing the water pollution presently being caused by the armies. Similarly, the countries could also recognise certain flagship species to draw the attention of political leaders and concerned people. Experts have identified five species corresponding to five ecological epochs found at the India-Pakistan border. This includes Snow Leopards from the Trans-Himalayan region, Kashmir Markhor in the Himalayan region, Bar-headed Goose in the Semi-Arid region, Great Indian Bustard in the Desert region, and Indian Wild Ass in the Rann of Kutch. Peace Park could also signal the beginning of a peaceful relationship between India and Pakistan.\nCeasefires, on the other hand, can have immediate benefits to the ecosystem. For instance, the ceasefire reinforcement in 2022 led to an additional 15 migratory bird species (alongside usual visitors such as bar-headed goose) being seen in the Gharana wetland region. Additionally, removal of landmines would prevent unnecessary deaths of animals. Although exact damages are unknown, both the Russia-Ukraine and the Israel-Palestine conflicts have shown the devastating impacts of war on biodiversity, which should become a lesson for all countries in conflict including India and Pakistan to not go into wars in future. Finally, exercise empathy and compassion for fellow humans and individuals of other species. Empathy at a people-to-people level and at the diplomatic level would go a long way with conservation efforts. A simple recollection in our collective conscious of bear cubs separated from their mother because of a human-made fenced border is enough to remind ourselves of devastating consequences of borders on wildlife. Countries are constructs of humans; no other species defines boundaries in their habitats. Impositions of our boundaries cannot have spillover effects. Therefore, countries must make peace to co-exist with fellow species on the planet. Animals like Asiatic bears at the India-Pakistan border should be able to move freely, claiming back all their territory, and living their regular lives. India and Pakistan might be divided by their conflict over land acquisition, however, they must come together to give back the very same land to ones that equally are part of the planet: wildlife.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-06-foreign-policy-op-ed-02/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e“Twin orphaned bear cubs given shelter near India-Pakistan border”, read a Reuters News headline.

I found Social History fascinating because it weaves together the lived experiences of people from the past. What piqued my interest was how there are certain culminating events in history—such as the Beveridge Report becoming popular—but the event in itself does not tell us the whole story. It is only when we situate that event in the mundane of every day and look at the ideas of the time, does the real picture of the past emerges. In that regard, I was drawn to the work of journalist Charles Madge, the anthropologist Tom Harrisson, and the filmmaker Humphrey Jennings in documenting the “Collective unconscious” through “Mass-Observations”. In particular, there was this statement on why British people, particularly middle-class people, were having smaller families than they had in the past, which read: “People lacked faith in the future. Not a belief that things are going to be tough, and it will take a long time to get right \u0026hellip; But a belief that nobody’s going to try and put things right and improve them, that the nation is going to muddle on through the chaoses [sic] of another 1919–39 to another world war in 1965.”\nDid this collective unconscious influence Beveridge when he wrote his report, when he proposed his new imagination for a welfare state, or when he said, “Bread for all before cake for anybody”? I believe so. It also made me wonder, what is the collective unconscious of the present India? Is there still a doomist perspective on life, in general? The first thought that came to me was climate change. I cannot speak for all, but at least in urban spaces, there is growing climate anxiety as extreme weather events become more frequent. I have heard some friends say they do not want to have kids because they worry the world might not be a conducive place to live. Access to healthcare—which is, in part, also influenced by climate change—is still a major concern, too. However, on second thought, I realised that the existence of the internet and social media might influence the collective unconscious. Maybe if one can sift through the polarised debates, misinformation and hoaxes, an understanding of the collective unconscious emerges. Or perhaps studying these polarised debates itself gives us a pulse for what society is thinking about?\nIt is still interesting to ponder how might this collective unconscious influence the functioning of society. How, if at all, might it influence the welfare state? Maybe, time will tell?\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-06-the-welfare-state-critical-notes-02/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eReading excerpts from Bread For All by Chris Renwick was my first introduction to Social History. I found Social History fascinating because it weaves together the lived experiences of people from the past. What piqued my interest was how there are certain culminating events in history—such as the Beveridge Report becoming popular—but the event in itself does not tell us the whole story. It is only when we situate that event in the mundane of every day and look at the ideas of the time, does the real picture of the past emerges. In that regard, I was drawn to the work of journalist Charles Madge, the anthropologist Tom Harrisson, and the filmmaker Humphrey Jennings in documenting the “Collective unconscious” through  “Mass-Observations”.  In particular, there was this statement on why British people, particularly middle-class people, were having smaller families than they had in the past, which read: “People lacked faith in the future. Not a belief that things are going to be tough, and it will take a long time to get right \u0026hellip; But a belief that nobody’s going to try and put things right and improve them, that the nation is going to muddle on through the chaoses [sic] of another 1919–39 to another world war in 1965.”\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Term 06 | The Welfare State | Critical Reading Notes on Bread For All (Introduction)"},{"content":"At my previous workplace, I was involved in public health communication for rare genetic diseases. Our team’s table read of the National Policy for Rare Diseases (NPRD), 2021, exposed me to the intricacies of India’s present-day healthcare system. We had extensive discussions about how essential services—such as genetic counseling, newborn screening, and early detection of non-communicable diseases—should be part of the Primary Health Care (PHC) system. Adding to these conversations was The India Forum article, Right to Healthcare in Times of Universal Health Coverage, which gave me a framework to think about and possibly reimagine the healthcare system.\nGuided by the pillars of the healthcare framework—Right to Healthcare and Universal Health Coverage—the article argues “for states to reorient and reorganize their health systems, consciously and foundationally based on a comprehensive primary healthcare approach.” Although I am speaking for an edge case of rare genetic diseases, the comprehensive approach is essential to ensure equitable healthcare for patients. For example, if PHCs are equipped, both in terms of knowledge and resources, to diagnose rare genetic diseases (RGDs) in patients, it would significantly reduce the average diagnosis period (currently seven years) and ensure equitable access to treatment, which would not be restricted to affluent individuals. Therefore, we cannot have PHCs that only “cover some aspects of reproductive health services and a few disease control programs while the rest are left to private markets.”\nThe article highlights challenges with the pillars themselves. Health rights are liable to be used to expand the entitlements of the rich, and universal coverage has come to be predominantly associated with public financing of private provision and big pharma rather than strengthening public health systems to ensure access for all. This critical point made me question who the actual beneficiaries of universal coverage and health rights are. I know of certain Patient Advocacy Groups (PAGs) fighting in court to secure the insufficient ₹20 lakhs promised by NPRD for their children. However, the article highlights the other side of the coin, where “pharmaceutical companies have been found to have had an active role in bringing right to health cases to court.” Are these health schemes emulating a sort of cash transfer between the government and big private entities?\nFinally, the questions I am left with are: How do we prioritise building a comprehensive primary health care system, when there are resource constraints and advantage-seekers? How do we define rights and coverage in a way that closes these gaps and ensures that the welfare state benefits only its citizens?\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-06-the-welfare-state-critical-notes-01/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAt my previous workplace, I was involved in public health communication for rare genetic diseases.

It was a fun group watching, cheering, screaming, and witnessing a win. India won, yes.\nThat brings us to today.\n2025-03-10 Monday was supposed to be a regular YIF day. We had an early morning class (0900 is early), Office Hours, and another class. However, one of the Office Hours with Prof. Krishnamurthy left me very unsettled. She brough up how my label of science communication constrains my ability to truly learn, and how, for a communicator, it is important to know how to learn. She also said that, in order for me to be a confident communicator, I need to have learnt a lot. Usually, the first Office Hours are meant for us to get to know each other, and this coming out of nowhere took me aback. Ofcourse, I agree to most of what she said. I really haven\u0026rsquo;t had the chance to reflect on how I have been learning at the YIF and whether it has been of any meaning.

We had a peer review exercise, where we went over each other\u0026rsquo;s writings about English curriculum development.\nFinally, I focused the rest of the day on Chevening. I spoke to Nehal, clarified about some of the interview questions and had a mock with Peter. They were both useful in helping me realise that I need to prepare A LOT. A LOT.

As it is always the case, a LOT has happened. Any attempt to capture or document these few months would be an unfruitful exercise. Instead, I will quickly summarise some key events before resuming my usual weekly updates.\nTerm 4 (2024-12-24 to 2025-01-10): Making videos after videos! After returning, I was immersed into a block-taught course called Visual Storytelling and Cinematic Techniques. Looking back, it was a very useful course. I, for the first time, learnt video production and acting. From direction insights such as camera angles, shot types, cutaways, continuity, to technicalities of video editing\u0026mdash;we learnt it all. Naturally, the classes were quite intense, packed from morning to evening. Additionally, our ELM had added responsibilities of preparing for the India Science Festival, where we were showcasing the board game version of Pralay. I still remember those cold and gloomy winter evenings, when I forced myself to get out of my room to meet the team to discuss the logistics of making the game. It all came together at the very last moment.\nGoing to the India Science Festival, Fergusson College, Pune (2025-01-11 to 2025-01-14) I was such a chaos by the time India Science Festival came. I was unwell and burnt out. It was evident to others, too. For example, I forgot to take my laptop out at security. I kept obsessing that I had forgotten to pack the game tokens. I was also getting used to travelling with people, the last time I did that was back in May 2023 (Delhi Hackathon :P). The first night stay was a misery. We had booked a shady hotel, where cockroaches and other insects greeted us. Luckily, I convinced my team to book a better hotel for the next two days, and that made for a better Pune experience.\nRunning the India Science Festival booth was such an experience. We had so many people pouring in. We estimated that around 500 people played the game over the two days. I felt a bit useless because I could not speak Hindi. I am also not a people-person, I realised. However, the team did brilliantly, engaging the audience, keeping them captive. There were caveats, but it was one of my peak science communication moments of all time.\nMet some famiiar people and made some new acquaintances. The highlight was meeting Tuttu. I am so glad I met her despite how busy and tired I was.\nTerm 05 (2025-01-15 to 2025-02-19) Prof. Vijay and Prof. Butalia I started the next term immediately after returning from Pune. I was quite excited for Prof. Vijay\u0026rsquo;s first class and he did not disappoint. Along with his course on Climate and Geopolitics, we also had a course on Women, Society and Chaning India taught by Prof. Urvashi Butalia. YIF normalises having professors who are stalwarts in their fields. Where else in India do you get to take two courses by Padma Shri awardees in the same term?\nHowever, as fate would have it, I fell sick. A really bad case of stomach flu (it could have been a bacterial infection, too, I will never know). I lost almost 15 days of January to it. As a result, I lost touch with the courses. Prof. Vijay\u0026rsquo;s class got too political unlike the first class on developmental biology and evolution, and Prof. Butalia\u0026rsquo;s classes were not accessible due to my lack of familiarity with the discourse.\nFriends of YIF As the term 05 progressed, we got really busy with Friends of YIF, a live production hosted annually by all Fellows. It was one of the few things I looked forward to at the YIF. I gave my name for classical music and the end-performance. Overall, it was fun working on the performance. Learning a new keerthane took me back to my school days. It also made me realise how rusty my singing and knowledge has become. The rehearsals were intense and long. Never would I have imagined myself sleeping at 0200 for consecutive nights. As always, it all came together and the performance turned out great. It was livestreamed on YouTube and my family enjoyed my performance as well. Honestly, I was a tad bit upset that I did not get a solo performance, but I learnt a lot by working with the team.\nGood News After the Friends of YIF, we were back to Term 05 classes. Exactly a week later, as I was about to go to sleep on the 14th of Feb., I got an email from Chevening. I was in disbelief reading \u0026ldquo;Congratulations\u0026rdquo; in the title of the email. I had been shortlisted for the interview! Just when I was about to give up on my dream to do Masters in Science Communication. To celebrate, I managed to sneak in a visit to Delhi. Arushi and I visited Humayun\u0026rsquo;s Tomb and marvelled at Islamic Geometric Patterns. It was a fun day out.\nELM Immersion Week (2025-02-20 to 2025-03-01) The immersion was not so stressful. We worked mainly on design of the board game and aesthetic. Slow but steady progress. Nothing too fancy. I tried but failed preparing for Chevening. I also tried drafting my Inlaks application, and could not make much progress on it either. It is what it is.\nThat covers it all, I think. It took me roughly an hour to write, not too bad. Not many images to add.

The papers were technical, however, I knew enough scientific jargon to grasp the apocalypse predicted. One of the papers read, “under RCP8.5, a small fraction of the South Asian population (~4%) is projected to experience TWmax [maximum wet bulb temperature] exceeding 35°C by 2100. However, approximately 75% of the population is projected to experience TWmax exceeding 31°C, considered dangerous levels for most humans…” (Im et al.). This made me wonder: Are the people living in the regions-to-be-affected aware of the future they are about to face, let alone be prepared? Worse, “the geographical locations of the most extreme projected heat waves in the Indus and Ganges river valleys coincide largely with locations of highly vulnerable human populations in terms of population density, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and agricultural intensity” (Im et al.). How does one even talk about future projections when these vulnerable communities have more immediate problems of livelihood and survival to deal with in the present?\nThis made me realise that while climate science, politics, and diplomacy are complex, communicating complexities to a diverse audience is a problem in itself.\nApproaching the Problem of Communication Putting myself in the shoes of a communicator equipped with accurate scientific information on wet bulb temperatures, I listed my potential challenges I might face in having a dialogue with an Indian audience:\nDo my audience members have the same perspective and knowledge as me? Considering their priorities, backgrounds, beliefs, and ideologies, why should they be interested in and trust my message? How can I explain this concept while maintaining its complexities without resorting to technical jargon? Furthermore, how can I address the linguistic diversity present in the Indian population? To understand how to address these challenges, I set out on running an experimentation and reading marathon. Mini-Ethnographic Study to Know the Audience: Asking ‘what do you know about climate change?’ Addressing the first challenge. Over a week, I asked every person I interacted with one question: What do you know about climate change? By every person, I mean my roommate, my father, my best friend, my colleagues, the housekeeping didi, the reception didi, the printer bhaiya—whomever I met.\nThe motivation to ask this question was simple. We assume that almost everyone of us would have heard about climate change. While that is majorly true, what they understand of it varies significantly. Take for example, my roommate. She says climate change is increasing in global temperature and change in weather patterns, and is happening because of ozone depletion caused by carbon dioxide emissions. On the other hand, my best friend attributed climate change to pollution and deforestation. Although some of what they said was in the right direction, none of them understood what climate change meant—the long-term shifts in the global average temperature and weather patterns due to human activities, mainly carbon emissions. There was also a tendency to muddle other related issues such as pollution, deforestation, urbanisation, along with climate change.\nWhen I asked the same question to people who may not have had exposure to formal education, the responses were different. The receptionist didi said she had heard of Jalwayu parivartan in school, but she did not remember what it meant. The housekeeping didi, on the other hand, had never heard of climate change at all.\nSince I brought up climate change in conversations without prior notice, which might have taken people aback or made them conscious, the inferences from this mini-ethnographic study of mine should be approached with caution. However, it is still true that people’s responses varied diversely. Yale’s Program on Climate Change Communication reports that “54% say they know either ‘just a little’ about global warming or have never heard of it, while only 10% say they know ‘a lot.’” (“Climate Change in the Indian Mind, 2023”). Of course, this is not to call anybody stupid or ignorant. In fact, all the people I spoke to were experts/skilled in their own fields. Therefore, the fundamental problem of communication is, given the varying degree of climate change knowledge, how does one communicate a more relatively complex concept such as wet bulb temperature?\nOne possible solution would be having skilled and trained communicators initiate by first ‘knowing their audience’ and then contextualising the explanation of the concept. Furthermore, asking audience questions to prompt them to recall their lived experiences helps, too. For example, I asked many folks if they had experienced extreme weather events. My roommate brought up the unnatural winters in her hometown and the receptionist didi spoke about a 1995 natural disaster in Haryana. Building on this experience to explain anthropogenic climate change consequences would become relatively easier in most cases.\nHowever, gauging the audience’s prior factual knowledge is the first step. While engaging, a communicator has to navigate the attitudes about climate change, which is shaped by various socio-political factors. This leads us to the second challenge.\nNarratives about Climate Change: Influence of people’s beliefs, values, and ideologies In a country as diverse as India, attitudes are shaped by factors such as geographical location, religion, belief systems, literacy, and political views. Naturally, it is challenging for communicators to understand the specific socio-political background their audience comes from. Since research shows that people need to understand climate change as a narrative, containing their own language and shaped by their own values and experience, how can one effectively ground themselves to their audience?\nAfter conducting a literature review and parsing through many climate communication research based in the Global North, I finally found a report by Climate Outreach containing India-specific recommendations to weave climate narratives. In their report on Communicating Climate Change in India, they document “the language around climate change and renewables that speaks best to the values and identity of people across India—a country chosen because of its critical importance in the world of climate change. [The report] explores the attitudes of a wide range of people: urban professionals, remote farmers, people of progressive and conservative political values, and the young people who will determine the future of the country.” (One drawback is that the research participants are all from North India.)\nSome interesting recommendations from the report (Communicating Climate Change in India) that caught my attention were:\nReflect national pride in India as a country that is overcoming challenges and on a journey of improvement. Present climate change as damaging our connection with nature. Use concern about pollution as the key entry point for starting the public conversation. (stress the distinct role of carbon pollution in causing climate change. Present fossil fuels as polluting (rather than \u0026ldquo;dirty\u0026rdquo;), finite and imported. By contrast, present renewable energy as clean, unlimited and a proof of Indian self-reliance. Place renewables within a wider narrative of Indian natural abundance and diversity. Not to mention, climate change communication has become even more difficult in the digital post-truth era, where the information diet of people is restricted to their echo chambers. Combined with the socio-political factors, digital information spaces have become a fertile ground for myths, misinformation, and conspiracy theories to propagate. Therefore, as mentioned by Dr Ashish Jha (Dean of the Brown University School of Public Health) in a recent talk at Ashoka University, there is a greater need for communicators and researchers to go out of their science echo chambers and engage with that of, say, conservatives, or religious leaders, and have an empathetic and open dialogue about socio-scientific issues such as climate change.\nThe Language Finally, the challenge of language. India is linguistically diverse with 122 languages and several dialects (“Protecting Language Diversity in India”). However, when it comes to terms related to climate change, there are no direct translations. Even if translations exist, they are not colloquially known. In my case, not knowing fluent Hindi, I ran into an issue explaining to the housekeeping didi about climate change. Eventually, I resorted to using an AI tool to translate the definition of climate change to aid my conversation with her. Similarly, I tried to write about climate change in my native language—Kannada—and failed miserably. Since the communities vulnerable to experiencing maximum wet bulb temperatures are not English-speaking background, there is a greater need for more regional language communicators in India who can balance the complexities of climate change without using obscure native language phrases.\nHowever, even while communicating in English, there are several hurdles. Often, as communicators, one has to think about the framing of explanations and nuances to omit in order to avoid information overload. It is also essential to communicate uncertainties in the scientific understandings without leading to unhealthy doubt in the scientific process. One useful tactic is to shift from an ‘uncertainty’ to a ‘risk’ framing, which also makes it easier for people to weigh up the costs and benefits of inaction, rather than getting stuck in the perception that knowledge is still imperfect (Corner et al.). For example, “approximately 75% of the population is projected to experience TWmax exceeding 31°C, considered dangerous levels for most humans…”, the risk is directly communicated impactfully.\nConclusion Fig. (B to D) The spatial distributions of bias-corrected ensemble averaged 30-year TWmax for each GHG scenario: HIST (1976–2005) (B), RCP4.5 (2071–2100) (C), and RCP8.5 (2071–2100) (D) (Im et al.). I would like to end the essay with these maps predicting a hot and humid future. They show that almost all of India would experience maximum wet bulb temperature at least once if the emissions are not curbed or only moderately mitigated (Im et al.). I cannot help but stare at this grim future and feel frustrated that not many people in my country know what the future holds for generations to come. However, a slow but steady progress towards dialogue-based open climate communication in the Indian context, backed by social science research offers hope. Modifying this famous quote by Sir Mark Walport (ex-director of Wellcome Trust UK), “Science is not complete until it is communicated”, I would say the climate crisis will never be solved until it is communicated.\nWorks Cited “Climate Change in the Indian Mind, 2023.” Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-indian-mind-2023/toc/2/.\nCommunicating Climate Change in India. climatenetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/climate_outreach_can_-_global_narratives_india4.pdf.

One of the papers read, “under RCP8.5, a small fraction of the South Asian population (~4%) is projected to experience TWmax [maximum wet bulb temperature] exceeding 35°C by 2100.

December was indeed an interesting curveball I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting.\n2024-12-22 The last day of Organizational Dynamics. It started at 0930. The lectures were boring, honestly. In the afternoon, we were given the final group assignment to express our learnings from the course through a creative piece. Although I was initially hesitant, I ended up dancing with the group. It was definitely a memorable experience, and I am super grateful to my team.\nThe day became exhausting as we continued with lectures and the final activity of expressing gratitude to each other. The class became incredibly noisy, which made me leave earlier. I also had to pack to go back home. Packing didn’t take as long. Pravin was around as I packed, so it wasn’t a boring activity either. However, the worst part came when I couldn’t sleep. I had dreamed of going home almost every day since the second month of staying at Ashoka. The day had finally arrived... Going back home\u0026hellip; 2024-12-23 I woke up at 0430 and got out of bed at 0515. I was pooling a cab with a fellow Fellow, Jahnavi. My flight was at 11:45. We reached Delhi airport surprisingly early at 0715. After security, I stopped by Carnatic Cafe for Masale Dose. It was yum. After a quick round of shopping, I napped for a bit before heading to my gate. The flight ride was quiet. I only regretted not getting my neck pillow. But my anticipation of returning home made me restless, and I wouldn’t have slept well anyway.\nAfter landing, I felt overjoyed reading \u0026ldquo;Bengaluru Airport\u0026rdquo; written in Kannada. As I stepped out and took my first breath, I couldn’t help but smile under my mask. Distance does make you grow fonder of your homeland.\nI was staying in Bangalore for a night, and Adrian had booked a guest room for me at the BLiSc campus. After having a delightful small talk in Kannada with the cab driver, I made it to the inSTEM gate and was greeted by Adrian.\nI freshened up and left to meet my TIGS colleagues. Coincidentally, it was one of my colleagues\u0026rsquo; send-offs. I got to meet everyone at the same time and also send her off. I spent about 15 minutes later looking at the progress on some of the projects I had started. I was happy to see that they were being taken forward. Adrian seemed super busy, so I met Vishal at C-CAMP instead. He was the annoying person he always is, but there was some comfort in seeing his familiar face. He gave me a couple of chocolate bars (which came in handy later when I traveled to my grandparents\u0026rsquo; place).\nFinally, I went over to NCBS. Adrian was talking to his PI, and I went off to wander. I bumped into Chandrani, my ex-roommate. She was taken aback, as expected. We also met baby Shaon on the way. At the canteen, I met Siddharth and Shreekant. Meeting people one after another made me realize that I actually know a lot of these people! Even the canteen staff recognized me :)\nOver dinner, we mostly spoke about the YIF, interspersed with other folks describing their work. I retired to my room after dinner and dozed off.\nAdrian woke me up. I went over to his Naidile room. It was beautifully curated :) I wish I had photographed it. We spent some time talking, and he played the bass guitar. We also played a game of UNO (I lost, hehe). I came back to my room and slept.\n2024-12-24 I woke up early the next morning despite being tired. I went over to the medical shop nearby for essentials. All of the previous day, I had used dish soap to wash my hands. I showered, journaled, and left to have breakfast at C-CAMP. It was nostalgic because the only time I had breakfast there was on my joining day. Over breakfast, we spoke about Adrian\u0026rsquo;s experiment.\nI went on a quick Archives tour. They had an exhibit on the Green Revolution. I met Siddharth at the Acad canteen next. We had a useful discussion about the current status of science communication in India and a potential abstract for the critical writing conference.\nI went back to InSTEM for lunch with Adrian and then left. On my way, I had an argument with Karthik about a comment I had made the previous day. It wasn’t fun. After reaching Mysore, Dad picked me up.\nI freshened up after coming home, sang with my mum and sister, and slept.\n2024-12-25 Lazy day at home. I tried learning Affinity and writing but essentially did nothing. Scrolled and scrolled and scrolled on my phone.\n2024-12-26 I spent the morning working on a movie date poster for Karthik. We watched How to Train Your Dragon 2 in the afternoon (his choice). I met my ELM team in the evening. Ate dinner, packed, and slept.\nOff to Sirsi 2024-12-27 I had forgotten to set an alarm and was grateful for having proactive parents who bang on the door to wake their kid up. Left for the station. Nostalgia started hitting as Dad dropped me off and when the train journey started.\nI slept for a bit, had breakfast, and started taking pictures. I also did some reading: The Philosophy of Science book, Siddharth\u0026rsquo;s paper on scientific temper, and The Art of Statistics book. I also tried to do some writing, but was unable to.\nAfter entering the Western Ghats, the views became more scenic, and all I did was look out. I also really needed to pee, but the washroom smelled awful. My kaaka was late by 45 minutes in picking me up, which made me slightly annoyed. We ate at a local restaurant (my anxiety went through the roof). We went to the market for some shopping before heading to Kadnamane, my paternal grandparents\u0026rsquo; place.\nI greeted all my family members, freshened up, spent time learning more about my youngest cousin (who is now 2 years old). I was pleasantly surprised by how well the internet worked there. I could speak to anybody!\nArushi got really curious about life in villages and bombarded me with so many questions. She was also fascinated by our home. I sent her picture after picture. We even agreed to co-own a place designed by her.\nBefore going to sleep, I gazed out and saw so many stars! It was blissful :)\nSlept well.\n2024-12-28 The only full day at Kadnamane. I had Tellevu for breakfast immediately after waking up. I went on a walk to our farm and took a lot of pictures. Sent them to friends. Showered. Spent some time with my cousin. Had lunch. Rested a bit. Went on a hike to witness a beautiful sunset. Came back. Ate. Spent time with my cousin. Ate dinner. Ranted to a friend about the medieval practices in villages. Gazed at the stars and slept.\nIt felt really nice to slow down, unwind, and relive my summer holiday routine. I was constantly hit by nostalgia almost every minute I was there.\n2024-12-29 After waking up, I had Tellevu for breakfast, showere, packed, and left for Muttige, my maternal grandparents\u0026rsquo; place. There, I met my uncle and aunt and another set of grandparents. I felt nostalgia again while helping them with lunch and eating together. Sadly, it was time to leave. The ride to the train station was quick. We were 20 minutes early.\nThe journey back was boring. I was glued to my seat the whole time. The train was full.

At first glance, one might argue that removing non-factual content, such as \u0026ldquo;vaccines cause autism\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;plant X has proven to cure Y disease,\u0026rdquo; might be the best option to prevent its further spread. However, the problem is that non-factual content is complicated and takes many forms—misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories—all of which require different approaches to address.\nFor example, if someone claims that vaccines cause autism, it is important to recognize that they are basing their argument on a scientific paper that was once published and later retracted. This brings me to my first point: contrary to society’s perception of science as a collection of facts, the power of science lies in its uncertainty. When researchers publish a finding, they attach a specific uncertainty to it. This means that when presented with sufficient evidence, that finding can be refuted. For an observer, science correcting itself to make progress might sound confusing; what was once considered a fact may no longer be a fact. Therefore, improving scientific literacy should be at the heart of combating misinformation caused by a lack of understanding of scientific processes. Censorship does not address this.\nCensorship also leads to another problem: it pushes misinformation into “harder-to-reach corners of the internet.” My preliminary research on vaccine misinformation on YouTube suggests that non-factual anti-vaccine content has become harder to find compared to a few years ago. But when you dig deeper into the comments, you find anti-vaccine content. Therefore, censorship is not directly leading to the anti-vaccine community becoming smaller; they are still present, but they no longer immediately appear in mainstream social media search results. In some sense, this is good because there is a reduced chance of a user stumbling upon a misinformation post by chance. However, this is my second point: it also makes it harder to address the issue of misinformation itself, as it continues to propagate within its echo chambers.\nDisinformation and conspiracy theories, such as “the Earth is flat,” “climate change is not real,” and “5G causes the spread of coronavirus,” are among the most complex types of non-factual content to deal with. In these cases, there are people at extremes, and what gets censored directly influences the discourse about the issue.\nWhat should we be doing to combat non-factual information, then? Researchers suggest that there should be open, transparent discussions, which need to be fostered by social media platforms. Fact-checking, done both at individual and organizational levels, plays a crucial role in carefully debunking arguments and thereby ensuring a balanced conversation. There also needs to be trust built between scientific organizations and citizens. Algorithms, too, can be modified in such a manner that misinformation once flagged appears less often on people’s feeds, thereby limiting its reach. Circling back to the process of science, conversations on social media about science should also involve a back-and-forth, where users use the latest evidence while making claims.\nWorks Cited “Royal Society Cautions against Censorship of Scientific Misinformation Online | Royal Society.” Royalsociety.org, 19 Jan. 2022, royalsociety.org/news/2022/01/scientific-misinformation-report/.

I am super excited to finally attend the ISF after wanting to do so for 3 years. The team has spent many hours developing the board game version for the booth.

So far, I have written 6 essays for NGIA and completed 2 quizzes for Economics.\nThe NGIA course is not as fun as I thought it would be. It feels very scattered, making it hard for me to fully absorb everything the professor talks about. However, I have been introduced to blockchain, zero-knowledge proofs, surveillance on the internet, rabbit holes, echo chambers, and so on. Economics, on the other hand, has been insightful. Learning about a new discipline in an organized fashion is the best kind of learning joy I can ever experience. Prof. Shiv Kumar delivers that. Of course, microeconomics has its limitations (just like a physicist\u0026rsquo;s spherical cow), but it is still useful to learn the basic principles being taught.\nI did not enjoy doing the Critical Writing Ethnographic study and report. Maybe it was the topic, the timing, or the team—I can\u0026rsquo;t pinpoint it. I\u0026rsquo;m glad it\u0026rsquo;s over, and we finally managed to submit something satisfactory.\nOther Tidbits I have been reading quite a bit: Palestine by Joe Sacco, Big Data by Dawn E. Holmes, Philosophy of Science by Samir Okasha, Evolution and Tinkering by François Jacob, Critical Theory, many articles for NGIA essays, and the list goes on. I attended a 3D printing Makerspace event. It was my first time with the machine. I enjoyed it but was disappointed that I didn\u0026rsquo;t get a chance to make a 3D printed object myself. I also learned about the RepRap Movement. At a student-led performance, I heard acoustic violin for the first time since I stopped playing. It made me emotional.

Waking up with a blocked nose is now a daily occurrence.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Week 15, 16 and 17| The Young India Fellowship"},{"content":"As a family, we seldom went out to the town together; naturally, whenever we did, it was memorable. One such event was registering for our Aadhar cards. One day after school, my parents and I went to a registration center near the famous temple in the town. I had no idea what Aadhar was, and my parents did not explain it either. It was a small shop with benches, and it was unusually crowded. As a jumpy 10-year-old, I did not want to wait. Hours passed. When our turn finally came, I realized why the process took so long: the biometrics. People had to try multiple times before their biometrics were recorded. Of course, this was in the early days, somewhere around 2010, and the process, I am sure, is a lot smoother now.\nYears passed, and I slowly witnessed how the Aadhar card became a ubiquitous requisite, for schooling to traveling. By class 6 or 7, the school mandated a photocopy of Aadhar to be submitted. For entrance exams, Aadhar was the popular choice. Next, the college wanted one. When I went to the bank to create my account, I submitted a copy again. Finally, I produced my Aadhar to get all my other documents done—Passport, PAN card, and Driver’s License. I continue to use Aadhar to travel. This is the story of millions of us who grew up post-Aadhar.\nAadhar has just always been there. It is hard to conceive a world without it. However, until recently, I had not critically thought about the role Aadhar plays in our lives. Reading a blog by Yale, I learned that thanks to Aadhar, “Banks and mobile phone companies have enrolled poor people who previously had been seen as too risky and cost-prohibitive to be viable customers.” It also prevented ration supplies from being diverted by the corrupt. On the other hand, Aadhar also opened up the issue of who owns biometric and private data. With all bank, school, and other related data linked to your Aadhar, it is not inconceivable to link the data with your behavior to surveil you. The Right to Privacy is now a Fundamental Right, but is it enough to stop the government and other stakeholders from harnessing your data? It is not clear.\nAs the blog points out, a pushback against Aadhar also comes from those who were threatened by the fact that it might reveal their private economic activity. This was mainly felt by the rich or fraudsters, who could be looking to use “concern for the masses as a means to sabotage a program that they want to get rid of.”\nHowever, life without Aadhar is presently inconceivable. Although not mandatory on paper, availing many private and most government services requires you to have Aadhar. As discussed by Kiran Jonnalagadda in his article “Life Without Aadhar,” creating a bank account, filing tax returns, and buying property—all these activities are incredibly difficult to accomplish without possessing Aadhar. There have even been cases where medical care was denied in the absence of an Aadhar card.\nTo conclude, I feel there needs to be more transparency from the government and UIDAI regarding what happens to the data. Alternatives to not having an Aadhar card should be spelled out more clearly when services are being availed. There also needs to be more awareness among the public, especially when there are people like me who sometimes accept impositions without question.\nWorks Cited Jonnalagadda, Kiran. “Life without Aadhaar.” Deccan Herald, 20 Sept. 2024, www.deccanherald.com/india/life-without-aadhaar-3200235.

Prof. Debayan’s descriptions of patients behaving oddly after their callosotomy—a procedure disconnecting the two halves of the brain—made me probe further.\nSearching YouTube landed me on the most popular video on this topic by the CGP Grey channel. It described the experiments conducted in the late 19th century on split-brain patients by Sperry et al., which revealed the different specializations of the left and right hemispheres of the brain, a phenomenon known as lateralization. However, I found certain phrasings in the video questionable. Specifically, it claimed that “you are two,” meaning that there are two separate minds in an individual—the linguistic “left brain” and visual-processing “right brain.” It speculates that, in non-split-brain individuals, the “right brain rose up as a companion without a choice.” The video ends with a deeply unsettling thought: “At this moment, in your normal head, there are two of you watching this video: one having a \u0026lsquo;mind-blown\u0026rsquo; moment, and the other mentally rolling its eyes at the obviousness of it all.” I found this perspective—that there are two separate conscious agents—somewhat misinterpreting the experiments.\nOn probing further about split-brain experiments, I found a video essay (about two hours long) by a science communication channel called The Art of Deduction, debunking CGP Grey’s video. This video essay brought out the nuances missed by CGP Grey. First, the need to use “hemispheres” instead of “brains” to refer to the two parts of the brain. Second, pointing out that a callosotomy does not mean that your brain is completely split in two, as this ignores other connections and parts of the brain. Third, showcasing that CGP Grey’s video is based on an early paper about a former army personnel, whose brain injury might have exaggerated the effects of the surgical procedure. Quoting a research study by Pinto et al., which said, “canonical textbook findings that a split-brain patient can only respond to stimuli in the left visual half-field with the left hand, and to stimuli in the right visual half-field with the right hand and verbally, are not universally true,” the video essay emphasized the differential response to the surgery by individuals. Pinto et al.’s paper indicates that “severing the cortical connections between hemispheres splits visual perception, but does not create two independent conscious perceivers within one brain.”\nIn conclusion, CGP Grey’s video was yet another example of oversimplification gone wrong. This criticism of the implication of split-brain experiment results does not undermine the fact that split-brain experiments are fascinating to watch. For example, there are perplexing videos where these patients are able to draw two separate shapes simultaneously with their left and right hands. However, it is also important to note that many of these quirks seen in the patients cannot be generalized.\nWork Cited Pinto, Y., Neville, D.A., Otten, M., Corballis, P.M., Lamme, V.A.F., Haan, E.H.F., Foschi, N., Fabri, M.

Decades of research show that vaccines save lives. However, there are communities of people known as anti-vaxxers who hesitate or refuse to get vaccinated. When faced with devastating pandemics like COVID-19, this \u0026ldquo;vaccine hesitancy\u0026rdquo; poses a threat to humanity. The advent of social media has only complicated the issue, providing opportunities for anti-vaxxers to spread misinformation.\nAs part of the Extension Notes, I looked at YouTube comments on:\nA short video about the rare side effects of COVID-19 vaccines by a news channel. An explainer video about the side effects of vaccines by a science communication channel. The goal was to explore the ratio of pro-vaccinators to anti-vaxxers in the comments for these videos. A natural assumption would be that the news video on rare side effects would attract more anti-vaxxers than the explainer. This also means that viewers of explainers are more likely to be the ones who already trust vaccines, whereas the majority of anti-vaxxers would not even click on it.\nTo test my assumption, I used sentiment analysis, \u0026ldquo;the process of analyzing large volumes of text to determine whether it expresses a positive sentiment, a negative sentiment, or a neutral sentiment\u0026rdquo; [IBM].

on average, had 15% positive sentiment comments. The news video had more comments with negative sentiments compared to the explainer. The manual reading of the comments told a slightly different story. Contrary to my assumption, there were a significant number of anti-vaxxers in the comment section of the explainer video. Note that being in the comment section may or may not mean that they have actually watched the video. There was also hate between the two polarized communities seen in these comments.\nAs I read the comments, I also realized that sentiment analysis might not have been the best method for determining whether the commenter was an anti-vaxxer or not. First, there are junk comments that need to be removed. Second, an anti-vaxxer could say, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m glad I did not take the vaccine,\u0026rdquo; which would be labeled as positive, whereas a comment by a pro-vaccine user, such as \u0026ldquo;the vaccine does not cause autism,\u0026rdquo; gets labeled as negative. Therefore, there is a need to fine-tune transformer models in order for them to label the comments as positive, negative, or neutral in the context of vaccines and the content of the video. Or at the very least, the interpretations of the sentiments should be done in the context of the video.\nFrom my limited review of the literature, I identified that YouTube comments have not been formally studied to understand how misinformation spreads. This only reinforces what Prof. Debayan mentioned in class about YouTube comments being an underexplored avenue in research.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-03-ngia-essay-04/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"anti-vaxxers----where-are-they\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnti-Vaxxers \u0026ndash; Where Are They?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecades of research show that vaccines save lives. However, there are communities of people known as anti-vaxxers who hesitate or refuse to get vaccinated. When faced with devastating pandemics like COVID-19, this \u0026ldquo;vaccine hesitancy\u0026rdquo; poses a threat to humanity. The advent of social media has only complicated the issue, providing opportunities for anti-vaxxers to spread misinformation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of the Extension Notes, I looked at YouTube comments on:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Term 03 | The New Geography of Information Age | Extension Notes 04: Anti-vaxxers---Where Are They"},{"content":"Having given a few tech demos, Prof. Debayan’s mention of Douglas Engelbart\u0026rsquo;s “Mother of All Demos (1968)” made me curious to watch it. The presentation was given at a conference in conjunction with a conference paper titled “A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect.”\nEngelbart showcased the oNLine System\u0026rsquo;s (NLS) features, such as file systems, text editors, and so on. He mentioned that his team used the consoles for “daily work,” perhaps making these the first-ever personal computers. It was interesting to see the seeds of what has now shaped current computers and the web, including hyperlinks, low-level and high-level languages, version control (bug and change trackers), compilers, file management, information retrieval, video conferencing, and so on.\nI had kept my expectations low, given that it was an old demo, but the video showcased the ingenuity of Engelbart and his colleagues. They demoed live at this conference in San Francisco and accomplished connecting to the console seamlessly with the Augmentation Research Centre, some miles away at Stanford.\nAmong the functionalities demonstrated, I particularly liked the following:\nText file rendering: I was struck by the clever data structuring and interactivity of the renders. The textual “statements” were also indexed, searchable, and hyperlinked. This is in stark contrast with the PDFs of 2024, which are unstructured and barely interactive. File system hierarchy. The key set, meant specifically for commands. Filtering using what we would now call primitive regular expressions: For example, there was a duty roster with role lists for all members. Using the compiler, one could filter for all members who knew, let us say, hardware. AI-Generated Summary of the Mother of All Demos Bridging the first demo of a personal computer with present-day technologies of Generative AI, I used Notebook LM to summarize the features demonstrated in the video. It made me realize the warp-speed advancement of technology. In 1968, a scientist showcased a bulky console, and within five decades, these portable computers have become not only ubiquitous but also possess capabilities unimaginable to the Augmentation Research Centre scientists, who were at the origin of its development.\nKey Features (As Summarized by Notebook LM) Hierarchical Structuring: Enables the organization of information in a hierarchical manner, facilitating efficient navigation, overview, and manipulation of complex data. View Control: Allows dynamic adjustment of how information is displayed, enabling users to focus on specific details or gain an overview, adapting to different needs. Hyperlinking (Jumping on Links): Facilitates navigation between different parts of a file or across multiple files, creating an interconnected network of information. Cross-Referencing: Supports linking between different parts of a document or different documents, enabling users to establish relationships and quickly access related information. Content Analysis: Offers a specialized language for creating search expressions, enabling sophisticated information retrieval based on content and patterns. Collaboration Tools: Includes features for real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to view, edit, and communicate on the same document. Specialized Languages: Utilizes a set of custom-designed languages, including control metalanguage, machine-oriented language (MOL), and content analysis language, to define system behavior, program functions, and facilitate precise communication. Unexplored Ideas Although most of the technologies were eventually picked up by corporations making computers, the sophisticated ideas – such as how to interact with and organize knowledge, and how groups of people can work with computers to increase collective IQs – were never explored to their full potential. Given the advent of technology, perhaps it is time to revisit the “Mother of All Demos” and think about, as Engelbart says, “getting better at getting better.”\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-03-ngia-essay-03/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHaving given a few tech demos, Prof. Debayan’s mention of Douglas Engelbart\u0026rsquo;s “Mother of All Demos (1968)” made me curious to watch it.

Previously, as part of a research project, I had spent a considerable amount of time understanding the current scientific publishing ecosystem, only to realize that it lacks transparency and is gatekept by a few companies. Further, the competitive nature of scientific publishing has caused nuanced problems, such as p-hacking, data fudging, and the reproducibility crisis. Since publishing is vital to the scientific process, I wondered if blockchain technology could solve some of these problems.\nThrough a quick literature search, I came across a paper titled “Blockchain, Wikis, and the Ideal Science Machine: With an Example from Genomics.” The author, David Koepsell, puts forth a novel approach that combines blockchain technology with wiki platforms to develop a “‘science machine’ that folds all processes together, from instrument to publication, enabling science to proceed as never before with greater transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.”\nTaking a typical genomics study as an example, the paper proposes a framework in which a unique hashed ID is given to the study’s subject, tissue sample, and deidentified genetic sequencing data, which can be accessed through a private key. The final product—the Wiki-style hypertext publication, which encapsulates the trail of the scientific process from hypothesis and data collection to analysis—is also placed on the blockchain system for the research community to access. Placing publications in ledgers allows the data to be decentralized, preventing the loss of information and monopoly by Western publishing companies and researchers.\nPerfect Science Machine\nHowever, adapting the blockchain system requires overhauling the current incentive system in academia, since universities rely on the reputation of journals to determine the reputation of scientists before hiring them. Therefore, along with proposing a decentralized system for scientific publishing, there is a need to develop a new system for evaluating the impact of contributions made by scientists.\nDemocratic Autonomous Organization (Mackey et al.) is one such attempt to retain the essence of the journal-based publishing system (ensuring that players such as reviewers, authors, etc. are retained) while leveraging blockchain technology to improve efficiency and transparency. I do not fully understand the framework, so I have referenced the papers in case anyone would like to deep dive.\nShared Blockchain Publishing Ecosystem\nHumanity relies on scientific processes to produce an ever-evolving knowledge graph, and there is a need to preserve the knowledge faithfully, decentralize it, while also accelerating the process itself. Blockchain, to me, offers hope.\nWorks Cited Koepsell, David. “Blockchain, Wikis, and the Ideal Science Machine: With an Example from Genomics.” Frontiers in Blockchain, vol. 2, Dec. 2019, https://doi.org/10.3389/fbloc.2019.00025.

I knew enough to ensure I checked the “Reject All” option whenever I visited a website, but I did not know the implications of not doing so. As Prof. Debayan explained how ad companies such as DoubleClick track me across websites to gather insights about my preferences and thereby show relevant advertisements, I became aware of my ignorance. I also realized that targeted advertising involves analyzing huge amounts of data and became curious to learn more about it.\nTo get started, I read a book called Big Data: A Very Short Introduction by Dawn E. Holmes. The initial chapters of the book cover how big data is stored and analyzed and lead up to the chapter titled “Big Data, Big Business.” Google, Amazon, and Netflix are used as case studies to discuss the Pay-Per-Click model, targeted advertising, and recommender systems (collaborative filtering and cosine similarity). The introductory chapters on storing unstructured data using the Hadoop Distributed File System and analysis methods such as MapReduce, PageRank, and Bloom Filters made me appreciate the complex and innovative algorithms built on top of these. If interested, I would recommend the book to learn more about these concepts, as I won’t be able to explain them in detail in these Extension Notes.\nIn particular, I was fascinated by the logic behind collaborative filtering, whereby an e-commerce product is recommended based on the purchases of other users whose profiles are similar to mine. This is done by using Jaccard’s index, which is defined as the number of items two sets (customers) have in common, divided by the total number of distinct items.\nLet’s say I am interested in cookbooks and have bought Daily Salads and Desserts Tomorrow from Amazon (Table 1). The collaborative filtering algorithm calculates Jaccard’s index for all the other cookbook buyers by comparing our purchases to recommend what to buy next.\nDaily Salads Pasta Today Desserts Tomorrow Wine For All Me bought bought Jones bought bought Brown bought bought Table 1: Books Bought by Me, Jones, and Brown (from Big Data: A Very Short Introduction)\nComparison Number of Titles in Common Total Number of Distinct Titles Purchased Jaccard Index Me and Jones 1 3 1/3 Me and Brown 1 4 1/4 Jones and Brown 1 4 1/4 Table 2: Jaccard’s Index (from Big Data: A Very Short Introduction)\nWe see that the Jaccard’s index is highest between Me and Jones. The book Jones purchased, which I have not, is Wine For All, and that is what Amazon recommends (Table 2). Cosine similarity is similar to collaborative filtering; however, it also takes into account the ratings given by customers for the products.\nAfter reading about all the different algorithms in the Big Data book, I paused to consider the implications of algorithms. Combined with my reading about the “Warehouse Wage Slave” experience (McClelland), it made me think that we are all at the mercy of a handful of giant companies. We are succumbing to algorithms like recommender systems, prompting these companies to develop even more complex algorithms to further exploit the ever-increasing big data we continue to contribute. We buy more and more products, leading to more and more warehouse workers robotically scanning and packing the products, like cookbooks the algorithm recommended. It is a vicious cycle. Will we even have control over our desires in the future? Or will they be algorithm-driven? Are we becoming robots? I cannot help but worry about the societal implications of these technologies.\nThis quick research has made me more mindful of the trail I leave on the web. Maybe it is time to move away from big companies like Google and Amazon and do more than just “Reject All.”\nWorks Cited\nHolmes, Dawn E. Big Data: A Very Short Introduction.

We had to back-to-back lectures. Woke up early, made it to class 20 minutes before it started. Prof. A. K. Shivkumar from Harvard is teaching us Microeconomics. I like his lecture-approach, simple whiteobard and marker style. We were acquainted with the basics of microeconomics. The problems of the society \u0026ndash; what to produce, how to produce them, how much. We discussed the need for intervention of the market \u0026ndash; supply-side and demand-side. We ended with with model of economy. In the last half an hour of the class, we looked at the case study: India in numbers.\nModel of Economy\nNGIA was interesting, too. We discussed China\u0026rsquo;s social credit system and surveillance. The course is taught by Prof. Debayan Gupta. It is a bit hard to keep up with him as he throws out ideas and readings. But I can see the course being fun.\nI had Office Hours with Centre for Writing and Communication (CWC) to discuss my application on which I had made decent progress, before going to the concert by Amit Chaudari hosted for the YIF cohort. Later in the day, I myself perfomed at the Broadway-themed open mic. Singing Let It Go from Frozen reminded of countless times my sister and I have sung this song together. It was special to sing this song to an energetic audience.\nI came back, worked on the application and slept late after fixing the argument with Karthik.\n2024-10-29 Another fun Economics lecture. We discussed the Demand Curve.\nIn the afternoon, our ELM team was supposed to have an interview with the India Science Festival folks but they did not turn up to the meeting. I had the Critical Writing class next. We disussed \u0026ldquo;Critical\u0026rdquo; theories and I lost my lecturer half way through.\nI spent the rest of the day on my application.\n2024-10-30 My nose was blocked, which kept me up for the better half of the night. Woke up late. Missed the first ten minutes of NGIA lecture. But the class discussion was great. Our case study was Amazon. We looked their business model, Bezos\u0026rsquo;s vision when he first started the company, and so on. We moved on to talking about ads, user profiling, cookies and so on.\nI had yet another Office Hours with CWC. It has been very useful to think out loud before drafting the essays.\nThe rest of the day was spent lazing around watching Kara and Nate, writing the essays in bits and pieces, and talking to Karthik.\nReading my essays\n2024-10-31 \u0026ndash; Start of Deepavali Break The campus felt very empty. In fact, there were only three people on my floor who stayed back on campus for Deepavali. I started my day with the \u0026ldquo;Study in the UK\u0026rdquo; essay. It took quite some time to research about the shortlisted courses and write something concise. I took the afternoon off to join the reading session hosted by the leftover cohort on campus. I read a chapter of the book, \u0026ldquo;Understanding Comics\u0026rdquo;, but spent the majority of the time socialising and listening to stories from people. It was relaxing.\nI came back to room, worked on my essays, watched an episode of Phineas and Ferb with Karthik (we had been meaning to watch it for a year now) and called it a day. I could not sleep for some reason. My body felt itchy and breathing became harder. I probably must have fallen asleep at around 0100.\n2024-11-01 I woke up late as a consequence of the disastrous night. I suspected bed bugs and washed all my clothes and bedding. I read FAST India\u0026rsquo;s SciComm ThinkLab report and STIP. I got introduced to The Very Short Introduction Series by Oxford by one of my peers and spent the afternoon reading the tiny book on Environmental Politics.\nIn the evening, we all got together to celebrate Deepavali. I am so glad one of us took the initiative to do something to mark the day. Although not grand, this was the first time in six years that I was celebrating Deepavali. Still away from home. Maybe next year.\nI finished drafting all the essays and felt very pleased with myself.\n2024-10-02 A regular morning. I read my essays again, made minor changes and finalised the version. In the afternoon, I contacted people asking for feedback. I worked on Critical Writing research project summarising one of the interviews.\nAbi arrived in the evening, welcomed her to room. The evening was spent on the new Very Short Introduction I borrowed from the library: Big Data. Post dinner, I conversed with a Chevening Scholar who gave feedback on my essays. I was happy that she thought most of my essays were great. Boosts confidence. She had several suggestions, I will working on them over the next two days.\n2024-10-03 Brings us to today.

As a result, I was stressed, confused, tired, agititated (fought with Karthik quite a lot). I feel like or even have the time to journal as you can tell. But we have made it through. Here\u0026rsquo;s my attempt at recounting key events from the two weeks.\nAt glance, here was my deadline list. Art Appreciation and Shakespeare combined, I had 5 assignments, a conference presentation (The Tech We Want), meeting with Prof. Vijayraghavan, a scholarship application (I discontinued working on it).\nMy deadline list\nAll of what I did Week 11 2024-10-07 On Monday, we watched Ram-Leela, an adaptation of Romeo-Juliet. For a movie with shooting, Bolywood drama, and so on, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t excepting to be in tears when Ram and Leela die. I gained more depth through the discussion in class, including the politics surrounding the movie and its name, the reason for extravagant set, the references to Romeo-Juliet, and so on. (Wish I had the time to summarise here).\n2024-10-08 We watched another adaptation of Romeo-Juliet, Arshinagar. It was a low-budget movie, with some very funny fight scences. I did not like it. After having a professor who knew everything about comics, I spent the rest of the evening working on the Art Appreciation group assignment. I was a bit disappointed by the team not synergising. All used Generative AI models for creating their content, I felt very lonely in the pursuit of actually trying to understand comics.\n2024-10-09 The Presentation Day Although not sufficient, I had curated enough material about comics to feel confident. It was important I felt prepared; it was first ever presentation to the cohort. The presentation went okay. The professor enjoyed. I sat through couple of presentations; they were interesting. Many were performed-based \u0026ndash; entropy through music, roleplay, and so on.\nLater, we had the Art Exhibition, so many amazing paintings. Our cohort is so talented.\n2024-10-10 We discussed Arshinagar, the movie, in our final Shakespeare class. I spent all my free time working on the Commonwealth Application. I eventually realised I did not have genuine answers to some of the questions. I felt incomptent to even describe why lack science communication is relevant in the present times. I gave up on applying. It was a tough decision, but in retrospect the right decision, because I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have had the time.\n2024-10-11 I spoke to Vijayraghavan. It was not glorious as I thought it would be. Here was the reflection I wrote:\nProf. Vijayraghavan and I set up the agenda for the mentorship sessions: figuring out what my next steps would be to continue working on science communication and open science. Prof. advised me to list science communicators, track their career trajectories, and analyse whether I can emulate their career steps. Similarly, he also suggested researching communication organisations (in general), ThinkTanks, and international grants, that might be interested in science communication. His idea is that I can join the communications team and pursue science communication.\nFor continuing work on open science, Prof. asked me what I wanted to do. Are there organisations I can work for? I discussed that organisations like Wikimedia Foundation, Mozilla, etc. have openings. But they require the employee to also take up managerial or technical work. Prof. suggested I showcase those skills to get the job. I have to be a science communicator and a manager.\nHe said that higher education is an option only if you are rich enough to study abroad. Yes, the degree holds an intrinsic value but its objective is also to extort money.\nAll in all, the call was a reality check. Prof. said that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be chasing exciting ideas and interests. The world will not support me or my interests. I will have to find a way to get someone to sign a cheque. Therefore, I should be thinking about how to fit into organisations, and have a longer-term vision rather than just pursuing interests.\nOver the week, in the Critical Writing classes, we studied Ethnographical practices. We are also assigned a group research project. Our group is studying how YIFs take decisions about spending their time.\n2024-10-12 to 2024-10-14 I spent these three days completely on the final Shakespeare assignment. Our team chose to reimagine Romeo and Juliet for art and science. We personified beaker and brush and through their conversations unravelled the interconnections between arts and sciences. In the short time we had, Arushi made drawings for every scene and we produced a stop-motion animation. For reasons, there was no synergy in the group and the experience wasn not enjoyable.\nOn 14th, I had office hour with a Creative Writiing faculty. She gave useful feedback on my previous scholarship application. There is so much to improve upon for me. I\u0026rsquo;m so glad I chose not to submit the Commonwealth Application, it would have been sub-par.\nOh, and one of the days, I got to know I was selected to attend SJAI conference :)\nWeek 12 2024-10-15 Shakespeare Festival I was blown away by the amazing reimaginations the cohort had produced. From musical, Qawali, poetry, comedy, to queer love, cross-religion marriage, and so much more! However, I did not feel fulfilled with our reimagination. The idea did not materialise the way I would have wanted it to.\nI had no time to relax. I came back and work on the The Tech We Want Summit slides and Art Appreciation final paper.\n2024-10-16 For the paper, not surprisingly, I chose to write about the power of scientific illustrations. I wrote case studies of Jane Richardson\u0026rsquo;s Ribbon Diagrams, David Goodsell\u0026rsquo;s cell landscapes, and Nirupa Rao\u0026rsquo;s tree illustrations. It was fun.\n2024-10-17 From waking up, I worked on making the slides for my presentation at The Tech We Want Summit. I was on the sustainability panel and had to be creative in talking about #semanticClimate from that lens. Peter explained how unsustainable PDFs are as they locks up the knowledge. #semanticClimate, by turning the document semantic, is helping reducing the opportunity cost aned making the knowledge usable. In particular, Peter re-discovered the concept of 5-starification of data and suggested we call our software chain as engine 5-starifying documents. I put together the slides in couple of hours and presented at the conference later that day.\nThe presentation went well. The Summit was well-curated and I listened to all the panels \u0026ndash; the poltiics of open tools, maintainence, and so on.\n2024-10-18 Started with office hours with our ELM supervisor, then spent the morning on our ELM. Later. I went to a higher studies career fair in the afternoon. They weren\u0026rsquo;t useful, but I was mainly there to collect brouchers I\u0026rsquo;ll never read.\nI attended Demo sessions of The Tech We Want, the tools were all super cool.\n2024-10-19 Anniv day Spent the morning and afternoon on the ELM. Later in the evening, we went around sticking posters to get people\u0026rsquo;s attention to fill our climate survey.\nKarthik and I watched \u0026ldquo;Inside Out 2\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;m super glad we spent quality time together. Arushi had gone out and got me a Palmier to eat. The movie wrecked me, but I felt so much at peace after spending time relaxing with Karthik.\nLater in the evening, I spoke to Adrian. I gave him updates about what had happened in the past two weeks (not too different from what I\u0026rsquo;ve written here), we discussed comics, nobel prize, views on AI, and much more. Slept late.\n2024-10-20 Worked till afternoon. Felt like our ELM team had hit a slump. Finally got to journalling. Spoke to Chandrani in the evening. In giving her a gist of the past 3 months, I realised the breadth and depth of work I\u0026rsquo;ve done so far at the YIF. After cutting the call, I went to meet Arushi and Shamant to discuss music. Post dinner, I met Pravin who told me everything about PowerBi and the big data work he does in the social sector related to schooling. He really has inspired me to work on meaninful data problems.\nReading List [Book] Understanding Comics, Scott McCloud [Book] Sequentual Art, Will Einser ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/week-11-and-12/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDays: 2024-10-07 to 2024-10-20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal two weeks of Term 02, Week 11 and 12, were filled with deadlines.

Learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else.” - Leonardo Da Vinci\nAs a non-artist in biology classes, I was always in awe of botany and zoology professors who drew detailed diagrams of, let’s say, a dissected flower part or insect organ on the chalkboard. The professors captured all the details a photograph would, except that the diagram was better at spotlighting the key characteristics of the specimen. To draw such a detailed diagram, one observes patiently and records — skills valuable to any researcher. Therefore, as biology students, we were encouraged to draw, even if we didn’t come with the skillset of an artist.\nOne might find scientific illustrations — especially of plants, trees, animals, and insects — obsolete in the digital age. However, that’s far from true. In this essay, using case studies, I will outline in-depth how scientific illustrations are an invaluable tool in the scientific process in the 21st century.\nIllustrations Visualize the Unseeable Beyond botanical or anatomical diagrams, illustration skills are useful in visualizing abstract concepts. Cellular and molecular biology involves studying structures smaller than the wavelength of light. Drawing models of microscopic structures, such as cells and molecules, helps a researcher understand biological processes, and generate and communicate ideas (Iwasa). Described below are three such innovations:\n1.1. Ribbon Structures of Protein In 1960, Max Perutz and John Kendrew deciphered the structure of a protein for the first time using X-ray crystallography. That protein was hemoglobin, which is responsible for oxygen transportation in humans. Once the technique was established, more protein structures were discovered. Representing these protein structures became a problem. Although proteins are small molecules, they are made up of several thousand individual atoms, making it hard for scientists to make molecular models. In the early days of structural biology, there was a need to devise a method to visualize these structures in order to communicate the findings to the scientific community.\nRichardson’s ribbon structures became a consistent system for drawing proteins. Quoting Richardson herself: “Ribbon drawings are an excellent tool for first comprehending the overall organization of a protein structure, on which cones can later hang the important details.” These ribbon structures are ubiquitously used in scientific papers and high school textbooks.\nTo solve the visualization problem, Jane Richardson, a biochemist, developed the innovative ribbon diagrams. Recapping high school biology, proteins consist of a chain of amino acids that naturally fold to form a 3-D structure. Linus Pauling showed that there are two basic shapes protein parts take up: alpha helices and beta strands. In Richardson’s sketches, “alpha helices are coils that look like the tails of decorative ribbons, curled with the edge of a pair of scissors. Beta strands are arrows that point in the direction in which the amino acid chain was built.” (Saplakoglu)\nRichardson’s ribbon structures became a consistent system for drawing proteins. Quoting Richardson herself: “Ribbon drawings are an excellent tool for first comprehending the overall organization of a protein structure, on which cones can later hang the important details.” These ribbon structures are ubiquitously used in scientific papers and high school textbooks.\n1.2. Cellular Landscapes Zooming out from proteins, we move onto cells. Until the 1960s, the cell icon resembled an omelette, with the blob of the nucleus surrounded by cytoplasm. In 1961, with advancements in technology, the icon was replaced by the cell’s illustration showcasing the subcellular structures.\nAn innovative representation of cells came in the 1990s. David Goodsell, a structural biologist studying biological molecules, started making illustrations of cells showcasing the complexity of cells at the molecular level. Goodsell uses scientific data from crystallography and microscopy to draw the structures of macromolecules, such as proteins. He combines the structural data of individual molecules with information on their interaction with other molecules and their position, size, and so on, to develop a cellular landscape. The result is an illustration that artistically depicts the complexity of a cell and accurately represents biological processes. He has a distinctive style for his paintings. He uses watercolors and simple pastel colors for molecules.\n1.3. Illustrations Frame the Unframable and Focus Beyond Photographs Conventional Botanical Illustrations The history of botanical illustrations goes back to the 15th century, all the way back to Leonardo Da Vinci and perhaps earlier. However, botanical illustrations are still relevant today. Since an artist can observe specimens from various angles and magnifications, they can develop a single drawing that highlights the key features of the species.\nTrees Imagine being a wildlife conservationist interested in visually documenting trees of rainforests. How would one fathom clicking a picture such that a 110-foot beast like Vernonia arborea (seen in the Western Ghats) is captured in a single frame? Two conversationalists, Divya Mudappa and T.R. Shankar Raman of the Nature Conservation Foundation, ran into this problem and decided to collaborate with Nirupa Rao, a botanical illustrator. Through the collaborative project, they documented 30 regional trees.\nIn her TED video, Rao admits that drawing trees is difficult. To draw a single tree, she had to observe the buttress by standing in front of it and climbing the cliff to observe the canopy. She also had to consistently observe the changes for months to draw all the organs (flower, fruit, and so on). By combining data points gathered spatially and temporally, she came up with a single illustration that had all the details of the tree — something a photograph or series of photographs could never achieve.\nRao has also documented rare species and biological events such as the blooming of Neelakurinji.\nConclusion These case studies show that the scientific process relies heavily on the innovations of illustrations. From proteins to trees, science has progressed because of researcher-artists\u0026rsquo; contributions to enabling communication and the common language of visuals in the scientific community.\nWork Cited An Illustrated Kingdom of Real, Fantastical Plants | Nirupa Rao.

I spent the morning on the Art Appreciation group project abstract and later figuring out deadlines.\nBack to back classes in the evening. I had fun learning about ethnography. We did a quick observation activity. I went to the library with my team and made notes about the environment and people. Shakespeare class was a little dissapointing. All we spoke about was death and desire and I got bored. My roommate and I had a karaoke night later. A nice distraction. Wish I sang more often.\n2024-10-02 Finally got the time to write updates on this blog and think about what to make for my final presentation. I had a tough conversation with Karthik; brain is a bit messed up.\nThe log is being written on 2024-10-20 i.e., 18 days later\nLater that day, I attended an origami workshop and had my first jam session at Ashoka. We sang Hindustani and Carnatic. I had fun.\nLater that week We read Layla and Majnun and followed it up with a classroom discussion. I remember feeling empathetic towards Majnun, the mad man. It was a really good introduction to Sufi literature.\nAs a part of YIF Mentorship Programme, I wrote an Expression of Interest to have Prof. Vijayraghavan as my mentor. He agreed. I\u0026rsquo;m excited.\nFriday and Saturday, we did some world-building for climate game. We played a game called Civilisation for inspiration.\nSaturday, I submitted the application to Science Journalism Association of India\u0026rsquo;s conference happening in Dec. 2024.\nOn Sunday, I had made my final canvas for my Art Appreciation course. I adapted an Islamic geometric pattern. It was therapeutic to draw circles and lines, and paint the shapes.

Worrin Muivah, the Alum this time, was such a fun person! He runs something called the STEP Academy in North East India. He said what he took away from the YIF was importance of building genuine relationships with people.\nWhat else happened? AC broke down. I slept at around 0200 one day. That was fun, haha. I attended Startup Ashoka to get a feel for the start-up culture and also talk to people about our ELM. Needless to say, I didn\u0026rsquo;t like it that much. I\u0026rsquo;m just averse to words like venture capital, business model, etc. But I got a nice hoodie, so I\u0026rsquo;m not complaining.\nDuring the weekend, I took interviews as a part of ELM. I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt so much more about games and sustainability initatives that exists already. Talking to as many people early on in the project helps in addressing some obvious but overlooked loopholes in the solution in the initial phase. However, it also confuses you because of conflicting opinions you hear.\nAND, most importantly, I went out to Delhi for the first time. I was supposed to go out with Arushi, but Arjun said he had time. This something I wrote on the Metro:\nBaby\u0026rsquo;s Day Out, Delhi Edition.\nFor the first time in two months, I managed to get out of Ashoka. Every time I tried to make plans, I had to abandon them because of deadlines or health. Finally, the stars aligned today.\nI met a friend of mine, Arjun, for the first time at Hauz Khas. I had my YIF friends to guide me to the metro station, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t hard. I got a bit nervous when I had to wait almost an hour at Hauz Khas metro for my friend to turn up. We went to Naivedyam for lunch. Decent Uttampam and great Chutney. Post lunch, We roamed around Hauz Khas village. We checked out a vintage poster shop, Chumbak, Minisou, and an art gallery. Awkwardness lingered for a while, but we got along well. We learnt more about each other. Spoke a bit about YIF and his work.\nThe experience of going out (minus the meeting part) was disorienting. Everything around me \u0026ndash; the stores, the roads, the people, the train, the station \u0026ndash; seemed familiar. Yet I felt paralysed. I felt like I did not know how to interact with my surroundings. Adding to the feeling was that I was not hearing South Indian languages anymore. Made me feel even more out of place, scared almost.

Naturally, I bumped into more non-kannada-speaking folks than usual, and English became my go-to language. Nothing to fret about. All my life I’ve enjoyed speaking in English. I took pride in being fluent in the language at school and even college. I often said I think in English. I had no issues giving presentations, making points in meetings, or having casual conversations at the workplace.\nBut after a while, I noticed something. When it came to emotions or describing an incident that moved me, English failed. I found myself reaching out to a specific Kannada word, only to not find an English equivalent. I missed speaking in Kannada. Maybe my brain was not thinking in English after all? It seemed like certain Kannada words and emotions were closely tied and imprinted, which English words could never replace.\nInterestingly, I knew only two languages until I went to college (Kannada and English). From friends and roommates, I picked up Tamil. And, somehow, because it was friends from whom I learnt Tamil, the language always offers comfort, warmth and fun whenever I speak it.\nTwo Young India Fellows also offered perspectives, which supplemented my experiences. Unlike my urge to switch to Kannada in certain personal settings, Arushi, who is from Jodhpur, said she has no difficulty expressing herself in Hindi (home language) or English. On the other hand, Sohan, a Bengali who has lived in Gurgaon all his life, shared a feeling similar to my own for Tamil. He remarked, “Hindi is a “Mazedhar” language; a language he loves speaking with friends”.\nIn conclusion, emotions around language seem to be guided by various factors. First, the social and cultural environment in which it was learnt from and spoken. Tamil (for me) and Hindi (for Sohan) are fun because we talk to friends in them. Second, the richness of our vocabulary and tight connection between specific words and emotions.

We spent the first hour discussing the relevance of the course by debunking myth that Shakespeare is English and elite. One common obstacle we face with Shakespeare is his language. We looked at why that\u0026rsquo;s the case, and how one can overcome it.\nLecture notes #01\nAnd, later in the evening, we had an open mic! I finally, after waiting for more than a year, got to perform :) I did a cover version of Love Me Like You Do, by Ellie Goulding. I was very nervous in the beginning, but I felt it leaving me towards the end of my first performance (thanks to the amazing YIF crowd). I had this familiar urge of wanting to perform again. Luckily, a batchmate of mine, had got a guitar and we ended up performing impromptu. A fun night performing and watching other people perfrom as well :)\nFirst peformance at the YIF\n2024-09-10 I woke up tired and hungry. But no choice. Had to get ready because for the 0930 Art Appreciation lecture. In the lecture, we discussed what art is, how we make sense of visual world, and so on. We also explored topics like scopic regime, gestalt. Towards the end of the lecture, we looked at some art work to understand what beauty and aesthetics really mean. In the evening, we had a Discussion Session, where we made sense of each others\u0026rsquo; paintings. It was interesting how none of the people in my group thought it was a \u0026lsquo;bad\u0026rsquo; painting.\nSpent the rest of the day on the ISF proposal.\n2024-09-11 Again, woke up tired and hungry. No choice. Art Appreciation lecture. We looked at does one make sense of art. Based on discussions from past two days, we arrived at: \u0026ldquo;Artwork embodies an Intention, which is experienced by Beholder, who uses sensations, knowledge and emotion to generate an artistic experience.\u0026ldquo;We looked at some case studies: Wind of Sea, Madhubani paintings and Yayomi Kasama\u0026rsquo;s work.\nShakespeare and the World lecture was super exciting. We discussed Ovid\u0026rsquo;s (Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;bro crush\u0026rdquo;) Metamorphoses. First, I was blown away by the insights the class had about the literary work. Professor complimented them to make the conversation complete. I enjoyed it. I\u0026rsquo;m now intrigued by the concept of Metamorphoses \u0026ndash; the chaos, the partition of inseparables by gods and humans, the order, the chaos which follows again, the cycle continues.\nClass Notes\n2024-09-12 Art Appreciation class as usual. We discussed Unifying Classical and Romantic, the reasoning and imagination. In the Critical Writing class, we explored the concept of literacy and distinguished it from literacy rate. We looked at literacy as something which is specific, plural and contextual. Finally, we had our first stage reading of Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s drama. We finished 3 scenes from The Midsummer Night\u0026rsquo;s Dream.\n2024-09-13 First ELM day. Went well. We did some logistical work, brainstormed a bit, called it a day.\nI attended the session on how to approach Masters application. It was one of the most useful sessions on higher studies I\u0026rsquo;ve ever attended.\nI ended up going to a movie called \u0026ldquo;Us\u0026rdquo;. It was my first-ever horror movie. Scenes were disturbing. The movie has a really good political message though.\n2024-09-14 Couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep well. Woke up feeling tired. Feverish towards the afternoon. Chills at night\n2024-09-15 Couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep well. Fever, chills, wisdom tooth ache. Went to the dentist instead of going with the cohort to National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA). Had an interesting conversation with a YIF alum who happened to come along with me in the ambulance to the dentist. Fell even sicker towards the end of the day.\nBut everything was slightly more managable because my friend, Arushi, returned to campus after 2 weeeks.\nReadings [Book] Blood and Beauty [Book] Metamorphoses, Ovid [Book] Exploring The Everyday ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/week-07-yif/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eTime is flying!

But I also explored how to run them in Python. So, it only makes sense for my final report to be an interactive Python file.\n# Import packages from scipy.stats import norm import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import random import seaborn as sns Part A Choose three of the four following statistical tools (A.1 – A.4). For each of your chosen three, write a short response exhibiting your understanding of the tool (250 words maximum each).\nA.1 Normal Distribution The Bell Curve: The one curve that rules them all!\nBefore we arrive at what a normal distribution is, I\u0026rsquo;d like you to devise an experiment.\nThrow a dice 10 times and note the average. An example outcome would be: [6 5 2 1 5 4 4 5 4 1]. The average is 3.7. Will the averages always remain the same? Would there be a pattern in the averages noted?\nMaybe you\u0026rsquo;d say let\u0026rsquo;s repeat the same process 10000 times. Of course, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t sit and throw dice 100000, would you? You get a computer to do it.\nAs you shall see below, I\u0026rsquo;ve written a few lines of code to simulate a throw of dice. I\u0026rsquo;ve asked it to generate random numbers between 1 and 6 (mimicking throwing a die) 10 times, note the average and repeat 10000 times.\nLooking at 10000 data points would be tedious. Instead, let\u0026rsquo;s visualise. A histogram plot reveals that there most of the average is centred around a number (mean) and it is almost symmetrically spread out. How data is spread is given by standard deviation. This type of distribution is a normal distribution. It is also known as a bell curve, or as the professor likes to call it: \u0026ldquo;The one curve that rules them all!\u0026rdquo;\nrng = np.random.default_rng(seed=2310) rolls = rng.integers(low=1, high=6, endpoint=True, size=(10_000, 10)) sns.histplot(data=rolls.mean(axis=1), binwidth=0.1) plt.show() rolls_sort = np.sort(rolls.mean(axis=1)) rolls_mean = np.average(rolls_sort) rolls_std = np.std(rolls_sort) norm(rolls_mean, rolls_std).cdf(4) 0.8176661208472158 We find normal distributions everywhere. Height and weight distribution in a class, people\u0026rsquo;s shower time, etc. Knowing that their distribution is normal will help you make useful inferences such as z% of data lies between x and y range. For example, 81% of the averages are between 0 and 4.\nStandard Normal Deviation When the mean(μ) is 0 and the standard deviation(σ) is 1, then we call it a \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; normal distribution curve. The area under the curve is 1. The concept of standard deviation is important, we will come to it in the later section.\nrandom_numbers_0_1 = [random.normalvariate(0, 1) for _ in range(1_000_000)] sns.histplot(data=random_numbers_0_1, binwidth=0.1) plt.show() A.2 Sampling Choosing a subset or sample of individuals from a statistical population is called sampling. Why is it important? Well, let\u0026rsquo;s go back to our die example. We were lucky that we could simulate 10000*10 throws. But let\u0026rsquo;s say you are collecting data on a country\u0026rsquo;s opinion on who they think would win the election, or you are a researcher testing whether a drug works and can be deployed to the entire population. Realistically, you get only a subset of the statistical population.\nNow, would the sample be representative of the population? In other words, can you draw inferences from the sample that is true for the entire population?\nTo answer this, let\u0026rsquo;s go back to our dice throws. Out of the 10000 averages, let\u0026rsquo;s get 500 of them at random.\nrandom_500_throw_averages = np.random.choice(rolls.mean(axis=1), 500, replace=False) sorted_500 = np.sort(random_500_throw_averages) plt.plot(sorted_500, norm.pdf(sorted_500, loc=np.average(random_500_throw_averages), scale=np.std(random_500_throw_averages))) [\u0026lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7f440f945db0\u0026gt;] You notice that the random 500 when plotted gives us the familiar bell curve. So, this sample represents the whole population of dice throw averages. However, is this always true?\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll reduce the sample size to 20 and see what happens.\nrandom_20_throw_averages = np.random.choice(rolls.mean(axis=1), 20, replace=False) sorted_20 = np.sort(random_20_throw_averages) plt.plot(sorted_20, norm.pdf(sorted_20, loc=np.average(random_20_throw_averages), scale=np.std(random_20_throw_averages))) [\u0026lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7f440fbd8340\u0026gt;] With 20 throw averages, the characteristic normal curve is gone. One should therefore ensure that their sample size is big enough. There are other aspects to consider, too. Is there a bias in the sample? Maybe during the sample collection, we somehow happened to pick up more outliers giving them a greater representation. The process of sampling itself introduces errors, that need to be accounted for. Therefore, analysing samples to draw inferences should be done meticulously considering aspects such as sample size, bias, error, etc.\nA.4 Randomness As always, we\u0026rsquo;ll go back to our die experiment. Think about a single 10-die throw. The outcome of that set of throws is random. However, we saw that after repeating the throws many many times, it followed a normal distribution. If you know the probability distribution, you can predict the probability of a given random event happening.\nRandomness is an important feature of data sets. For example, we suspected, in Sir Cyril Burt\u0026rsquo;s case, a possible fraud when we inferred that his IQ data were too normal, i.e., not random as one would naturally see. There are many statistical tests one can run like Chi-Square Tests to determine the normalness of data.\nWhat is interesting to note is that in the previous questions so far, we have used a Python module called random, which simulated die throws by providing us with sequences of random numbers between 1 and 6. We also used the same module to pick 500 random die-throw averages to form our sample.\nPart B Write three short responses (150 words maximum each) on three topics of your choosing from the course.\nB.1 What would Polya do? What would Polya do? One of the major learnings from the course has been Polya\u0026rsquo;s approach to problem solving.\nWhile doing the statistics assignments, we routinely ensured we asked the following questions:\nWhat is asked? How to tackle the problem? Oftentimes, we resorted to asking simple yet crucial questions like how many Pronto Pizza deliveries were above the limit of 25 minutes? Solve the problem. This was the fun part. I enjoyed learning about Python packages to perform statistical analysis. Look back and look ahead. While writing reports, we questioned what the inferences meant. We looked back to ask, for example, which days of the week are the deliveries late? This helped us give specific recommendations to the company (looking ahead). Any statistician sitting to analyse data should answer these questions, first.\nB.2 How to calculate the area under the normal curve? In our averages of the die-throw experiment, I made a statement that 81% of the averages were between 0 and 4. How did I get that percentage? I used one of the important features of the normal distribution. The area under the curve gives the probability of a given event.\nHow to calculate the area under the curve? The area under the whole of the standard normal distribution is 1. We scale and shift any normal distribution to standard one and obtain the corresponding area.\nThere is a function called the Cumulative Density Function (CDF), which gives us the probability value for outcomes between a range (0 and 4, for example). A single line of code saved tons of time I would have spent calculating the z-score, looking up the table, etc. Python is convenient if you know how to use it.\nnorm(rolls_mean, rolls_std).cdf(4) 0.8176661208472158 B.3 What is the right \u0026rsquo;n\u0026rsquo; (sample size)? In section A.2, we looked at the importance of sample size. 500 was representative of the die throw averages, whereas 20 wasn\u0026rsquo;t. How do we determine the right sample size? This is, as we alluded previously, an important question. It\u0026rsquo;s problematic if someone performs an opinion poll, and makes inferences not knowing whether their data represents the population. As a science communicator, I read scientific papers and have to make judgements on whether the authors\u0026rsquo; claims are valid. The table is below taken from the lecture on opinion polls. It gives you the sample size estimates needed to make conclusive claims about a population given an error tolerance and confidence.\nHow to read the table? If we tolerate the error of 0.1 (meaning our value is plus or minus 0.1 away from true probability) and confidence of 90the odds estimation to be right 90%, the sample size needed is 68.\nPart C Find a report in the news, in current events, in an area you are fascinated by, that allows for a statistical analysis. What is the report? What question are you trying to answer by analysing the data? What parts of the story are relevant in answering your question? What smaller questions might you ask as stepping-stones? What information do you need to answer these questions? What statistical tools might you use to answer these questions? Note: you need not actually perform the analysis though you can certainly see how far you can push the models if you wish. (500 words maximum.)\nC.1 Crowdsourcing Data Analysis While working on the statistics group assignments, a question kept bugging me. We were all given the same problem statement and dataset. Yet, I\u0026rsquo;m sure our statistical analysis and inferences would be different. Of course, a minority of the groups would have gotten their numbers wrong, made wrong assumptions, etc. But the majority of us would have chosen a statistical tool with a justifiable reason, cleaned data on specific principles, and so on. Can such good-willed choices also lead to differences? The answer is yes.\nA study on crowdsourcing data analysis published in 2017 (Silberzahn et al.) looked into this problem systematically. They got 29 expert teams to analyse the same data set to address the same research question: whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players. The result was unexpected. There was no single conclusive answer to the research question. Quoting the paper, \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;no teams found a negative effect, 9 found no significant relationship, and 20 found a positive effect. If a single team, selected randomly from the present teams, had conducted the study using the same data set, there would have been a 69% probability of a positive estimated effect size and a 31% probability of a null effect.\u0026rdquo;\nThe authors of the study tried to analyse why there was such stark variance in the results. They looked at analysis approaches, analysts\u0026rsquo; beliefs, expertise, etc. Through peer rating and assessment, they found that none of these had an impact on the differences in the results.\nAll this means one thing: when dealing with analyses of complex data, variation is inevitable. This is concerning. If a medical study conducted \u0026ndash; with all good intentions and careful analysis \u0026ndash; claims a drug has a certain efficacy, can we really trust it? Can we ever trust any published statistical analysis at all?\nTo address the problem of inevitable variability in data analysis, the authors of the paper suggest crowdsourcing data analysis is one possible solution. Apart from crowdsourcing, the research community is also publishing reproduction and replication studies to validate a study\u0026rsquo;s claim. Reproduction is an attempt to arrive at comparable results with identical data using computational methods described in a paper. Replication involves generating new data and applying existing methods to achieve comparable results. What should the lone analyst do? In statistics, there are now tools to \u0026lsquo;mimic\u0026rsquo; crowdsourcing, where the analyst tries every different defensible analysis and systematically arrives at an inference. To sum it up, \u0026ldquo;the best defence against subjectivity in science is to expose it\u0026rdquo;.\nComing back to the bugging question of mine. I think it would be an interesting exercise to perform a similar metanalysis as described in the study for our group assignments to quantify the variations in the results of our analysis.\nReference Silberzahn R, Uhlmann EL, Martin DP, et al.

I have been meaning to document learnings since Week 01, but I never found the time. Including a new habit into your schedule takes effort.\nDaily Breakdown 2024-09-02 (Monday) Made my CV After struggling for many months to perfect my CV, I finally finished creating one. I was asked by a professor to share my CV so he could look for a potential PhD advisor if I\u0026rsquo;m interested in pursuing one. I used Superset CV builder. Although it was clunky (with edit widget being too small and it taking forever to load), it helped me format my CV and restrict it to a page. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;ve done a good job at describing my work experience. We were asked to use the PAR Framework (Problem-Action-Result), but I got to lazy and copy-pasted details from my older resumes and modified a bit for consistency.\nClasses In our Leadership class, we went over what Mission, Vision, Strategy and Values were. It seemed like the professor had gotten Mission and Vision swapped when he explained. In the later half of the class, we discussed what liberal arts education really meant.\nNotes I took while reading Surely You\u0026rsquo;re Joking book on the side\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t pay much attention to the history class. We were critically examining Rasosundari Devi\u0026rsquo;s autobiography, My Life. We discussed what we can and cannot conclude from it about the lives of women of the time, what an authetic piece of historical document is, what questions to ask before making inferences from such texts, etc.\n2024-09-03 (Tuesday) SD Project At the YIF, we work on a project as part of Experiential Learning Module (ELM). As a Fellow, you are expected to work on either an external or self-designed project for 10 months to gain real-world experience. Our team pitched a climate change game last week and Tuesday, we got to know that we had been waitlisted. It was a bit frustrating that they repeated the exact same feedback for which we had responded during the interview.\nWe frantically contacted mentors for the climate game as that was one of the requirements. Karan, the director of the YIF, helped as well. He got us to talk to Prof. Vijayraghavan (whom I had always wanted to talk to when I was at NCBS), and the Professor has agreed to mentor us. It was a quick but useful conversation. Later, we brainstormed to come up with a mock-up interface.\n2024-09-04 (Wednesday) Last history lecture. Professor\u0026rsquo;s story about M.K. Gandhi had me teary-eyed. I rushed to the library to get the last copy of Kamaladevi\u0026rsquo;s s biography before heading to the ELM team-building session. We had fun activities \u0026ndash; answering trick questions and building a cardboard bridge. We then reflected on how we worked as a team.\nLater that day, we met Meghna Agarwala, a professor of Environmental Studies, to discuss the game. It was intense, but some questions she asked like what\u0026rsquo;s the message you\u0026rsquo;d subtlely want to give through the game, who is your audience, etc. really made us think.\n2024-09-05 (Thursday) First, I had an optional DS. I attended it since I thought I had time. Made a cute vision board for myself.\nWhere I would like to be in 5 years. Zoom in to read\n2024-09-06 (Friday) We had a half a day\u0026rsquo;s session on design thinking. It was fun. I spent the rest of my day working on the individual statistics assignment.\nCheck out my statistics assignment, here.\nAND we got to know that our ELM project had been accepted!\n2024-09-07 (Saturday) I had ELM sessions in the morning, which were semi-useful. We were taught how to define our problem statements. We were also given a rough timeline for the term. For the rest of the day, I was immersed in reading Kamaladevi\u0026rsquo;s biography. I\u0026rsquo;m geninunely in awe with her. I drafted part of the assignment, and called it a day.\n2024-09-08 (Sunday) Final assignment submission for term 01. Woke to fire alarm ringing at 0650. Turn out the alarm had malfunctioned. I was going to wake up at 0700 to do finish my assignment anyway, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t lose sleep unintendedly. I started off by adding context to the quotes I had picked from Nico Slate\u0026rsquo;s biography on Kamaladevi. Half way through, I had to stop writing in between to learn how to cite with page numbers. A useful skill. The essay really came together in the last half an hour. I\u0026rsquo;m happy I managed to make all the arguments although not in the grandier fashion I had imagined in my brain.\nRelaxed for the rest of the day.\nCheck out my history assignment here\nWeek in Summary Phew, had a lot of ups and downs this week. I\u0026rsquo;m proud of how my assignments turned out. I\u0026rsquo;m super pumped that our SD got accepted and that I\u0026rsquo;ll get to interact with Prof. Vijayraghavan more.\nReadings [Paper] Many Analysts, One Data Set: Making Transparent How Variations in Analytic Choices Affect Results A well-written paper on crowdsourcing analysis of data.

I wish I was better at articulating, but I love how badass she is. The book opens with this scene of her building city, which comes to be called Faridabad, for migrants right after independence. She goes abroad when she was 18. She does drama, theatre, activism, travel, writing, crafts, everything. She rebels, breaks norms.

However, abstracting our way out from this detailed perspective and instead looking at the Welfare State as a whole, we realise that “the welfare state is a distinctive form of governmentality: a specific mode of constituting the economy, assuring social security, and guaranteeing social provision (Garland, D., 2014)”. In this essay, I argue that scientific temperament should be one of the core pillars—if not the pillar—of this form of governmentality.\nScientific Temperament: How Does It Interact With the Welfare State? A term embedded in Indian discourse on science and science popularisation, scientific temperament was first used by Jawaharlal Nehru in The Discovery of India in 1946. Nehru writes,\n“The applications of science are inevitable and unavoidable for all countries and peoples today. But something more than its application is necessary. It is the scientific approach, the adventurous and yet critical temper of science, the search for truth and new knowledge, the refusal to accept anything without testing and trial, the capacity to change previous conclusions in the face of new evidence, the reliance on observed fact and not on pre-conceived theory, the hard discipline of the mind — all this is necessary, not merely for the application of science but for life itself and the solution of its many problems…(Jawaharlal Nehru, 1946, p.512)”\nFurthermore, Kankaria argues that ‘scientific’ in Nehru’s scientific temperament is:\n“akin to a mathematical function that operates on input variables in order to yield specific outputs. The input variable here is active citizen participation in knowledge-building, which can then lead to the output of an independent, postcolonial state that is freed from the shackles of dogmatic views, superstitions and pseudoscience (Kankaria, S., \u0026amp; Chakraborty, A., 2024).”\nScientific temper is now added to the Indian Constitution in 1976 under Article 51A(h), which declares developing of the scientific temper, humanism and spirit of inquiry and reforms as one of the ten fundamental duties of every citizen (Kankaria, S., \u0026amp; Chakraborty, A., 2024). At this stage, it is also important to note that this “broader national, social and humanistic context” (Kankaria, S., \u0026amp; Chakraborty, A., 2024) to scientific temperament framed in the Constituion consciously avoides the scientistic framings sometimes found in STEM rhetoric.\nA State where its “citizens actively participate in gaining both scientific temper and knowledge and its institutions actively promote this process (Kankaria, S., \u0026amp; Chakraborty, A., 2024)”, enables building of two crucial actors for its welfare state: Scientifically conscious and sceptical citizen communities.\nScientifically literate policymakers and care workers I argue that these two actors working in tandem build a welfare state which constantly betters itself through an iterative process of questioning and improving.\nScientifcally Conscious and Sceptical Citizen Communities Scientifically conscious citizens, as mentioned before, are actively participating in gaining scientific temper and knowledge. I envision them as critical thinkers who do not simply benefit from welfare schemes, but actively attempt to question and learn about them. Most importantly, they integrate the scientific knowledge with that of their lived experiences and knowledge. For example, when the government of India launched Digital India initiative—with the vision to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy (About Us—Digital India)—critical questions that a scientifically conscious citizen would ask include:\nWhat problem is Digital India solving? What are the potential problems that Digital India might inturn bring? hom does the initiative benefit? Are the majority of citizens digitally literate to transition? If not, how should one bring about digital literacy? When questions like these become part of the everyday, the collective consciousness (and unconsciousness) of citizens is more critical, leading to greater accountability by the government and even co-creation of welfare schemes. However, an ideal scientifically conscious citizen is a rarity. India poses unique challenges in terms of diversity in religious beliefs, ideologies, leading to prevalance of misinformation, pseudoscientific claims, and conspiracy theories. The lack of scepticism negatively impacts welfare state as one can easily fall for false claims. For instance, recently, a scam advertising a fictitious government job to entrap potential victims was reported (Sharma, 2025). A non-sceptical citizen easily gets lured by such traps.\nPeople’s Science Movement In order to build a State with scientifically conscious citizens, momentum needs to be built starting from the grassroots. Since 1960s, “the People’s Science Movement has worked to democratise the generation of knowledge and its dissemination and integration in Indian society, centring the sociocultural consciousness of the Indian people (How the People’s Science Movement Is Bringing Joy and Equality to Education in Karnataka, India, 2024)”. Given the neolibearal forces reducing science education to producing cheap technical labour forces, People’s Science Movement is a ground-up initative set up by teachers, science experts and blue collar workers to instill critical thinking and scientific temperament in government school students and wider public. They host several nationwide programmes such as Joy of Learning (1994), Cosmic Voyage (1995), People’s Reading movement — Jan Vachan Andolan (1995), International Year of Astronomy (2009), Surya Utsav (Solar eclipse festival) (2019) to a communicate aspects of modern science in an easy to understand manner. Intersecting more closer with the welfare state, People’s Science Movement in Kerala helped stop the construction of hydroelectric dams in Silent Valley of Kerala. Similarly, People’s Science Movmeent has played a crucial role in communicating the short-term and long-term risks of Bhopal Gas Tragdy. More recently, they worked on helping farmers unwrap the complexities of Genetically Modified Crops in resisting companies like Monsanto investing in pesticide resistant GM-crops, as pests (a biological being) can always evolve to counter the resistant crops (T. V., 2020).\nMovements such as these, also help indirectly in building Relational State Capacity as it boosts and strengthens everyday interactions of citizens with agents of the State. However, such movements are at a threat as the State is being shaped by neoliberal forces. As mentioned by T.V., critical sectors like health, education, and social welfare as part of its neo-liberal agenda are increasingly being left to ‘corporate social responsibility’ and “people’s Science Movements are finding it difficult to appeal to the moral economy to entitle and empower impoverished people (T. V., 2020).”\nWhat A Scientifically Conscious Citizen Can Do? A more positive example of a citizen critically questioning the welfare state is that of a YouTube creator called Bengawalk. The author has called out several of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) project including the Metro infrastructure and the never-ending road construction in the city. In the video on the road construction in Banglore, he digs up the Final Feasibility Report, which has proposals for 20 road construction projects. He points out that this report (on which BBMP spent 5 crores) has no budget allocated to make pedestrian infrastructure or to enhance public transport.\nFig. Still from the video on road constructions in Banglore\nLater in the video, the author touches upon the root cause of this road problem: the lack of elected municipal council for many years. Worse, the executive bodies are numerous but do not function complementarily leading to unresolved conflicts on policies. With no body making policies for the benefit of people, who is to stop polling of crores of money going to illogical and unscientific development of cities, which benefits the rich few at the very most?\nAll citizens must be empowered to ask such questions to the State like Bengawalk. However, citizens can develop an agency only if policymakers—who are on the other side of the equation—are also equally scientfically literate (and exist in the first place).\nScientifically Literate Policymakers Going back to one of the earliest welfare states, the U.K., we can see that Beveridge’s and Chadwick’s reports were very much grounded in the latest science of their present. For example, although incorrect, the miasma theory had an influence on health policies and the eventual birth of National Health service in the post-war Britian. Sadly, we do not find the same kind of engagement with science and research by politicians and bureaucrats in India anymore. For example, during the pandemic, instead of building good public health infrastrucutre, our prime minister diverted the public’s attention and asked the citizens to bang plates in gratitude towards the healthcare workers. How can citizens exercise scientific temperament if the top leaders spread false information and claims? And it is these very political leaders who continue to constrain funds for research and development. India spends only 0.6-0.7% of its GDP on Gross Expenditure on Research and Development (GERD). This leads to further decrease in scientific knowledge and temperament of the country.\nHowever, one must also be cautions about what science claims the policymakers choose to believe in. Take Beveridge’s association with Eugenics society. There is always a danger for an unscientific conclusion to almost sound “scientific”. And this is where the partnership between the citizens and policymakers comes into foreground. Through working in tandem, both actors can keep each other accountable, build relational state capacity, and prevent the derailing of ideas and policies.\nConclusion Fig. Relationship between Scientific Temperament and Welfare State\nIf policy makers are scientifically literate and informed, the welfare state governmentality would be based on evidence and knowledge created by scientific method. On the other hand, a scientifically conscious and sceptical citizens would not only benefit from welfare state, but can co-create the welfare state. In a utopian society that is scientifically tempered (in accordance with Nehru’s vision), I see a welfare state that has a healthy balance of scepticism, social security and vision for economic development. I hope the said utopia becomes a reality.\nReferences About Us—Digital India | Leading the transformation in India for ease of living and digital economy | MeitY, Government of India. (n.d.).

However, abstracting our way out from this detailed perspective and instead looking at the Welfare State as a whole, we realise that “the welfare state is a distinctive form of governmentality: a specific mode of constituting the economy, assuring social security, and guaranteeing social provision (Garland, D., 2014)”. In this essay, I argue that scientific temperament should be one of the core pillars—if not the pillar—of this form of governmentality.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Term 06 | Can Scientific Temperament Help Build a Better Welfare State?"},{"content":"As a student of science and education at a government college, I had no encouragement to keep up with current affairs. After all, my tasks were that of “pure science” like running experiments in labs. However, as years passed, I started having a more outward look, beyond the lab, and realised that science happens not in isolation. The very establishment where I perform experiments is shaped by societal context, and most importantly, local, national and global politics. For instance, if the funding agencies decided to cut funding to my institution, I would not have the chemicals to perform experiments.\nIn fact, fund cuts are a reality now. Recently in January 2025, the U.S. President Donald Trump put in place a 90-day freeze on foreign assistance under the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Although only 0.2% of USAID’s funds were flowing into India, the freeze has resulted in suspension of projects related to health (including HIV/AIDS, TB, maternal and child health, and immunisation programmes), economy, energy, water supply and sanitation, and environmental health. Many researchers involved in these projects might soon lose their jobs. If science policies are critical in shaping the lives of us, academic students and researchers, why is it not part of mainstream discussions in formal educational spaces?\nScience policy discourses are more important than ever in India since funding constraints science. India spends only 0.6-0.7% of its GDP on Gross Expenditure on Research and Development (GERD). Significant proportions of the funding pours in from the private sector and, lately, through bilateral and multilateral agreements with countries and organizations like the European Union, UKRI (United Kingdom Research and Innovation), BRICS, and others. Central Government and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) take up 50% of the expenditure, whereas, the State Governments get a mere 6.7%. However, most of India’s researchers are in these state government institutions. Therefore, researchers, specifically from state universities, are disadvantaged since neither do they get fundings from the government nor are they internationally collaborating. Since Science and Technology is increasingly seen as “soft power” by many countries, researchers—in order to secure independent funding through collaborative programmes—must be aware of the vested interest of the countries involved in bilateral and multilateral agreements. More importantly, in order for India to become an emergent leader in science, academia should exert force on the government to increase its expenditure on Research and Development.\nFinally, as mentioned before, science does not happen in isolation. Scientifc conclusions often have the potential to inform policies that impact the public. Therefore, as researchers, we must think of ourselves as either ‘Science Arbiters’ (who seek to engage and answer factual questions and queries) or ‘Honest Broker of Policy Alternatives’ (who aims to provide an impartial overview of all scientifically legitimate policy alternatives, strengths and weaknesses and their tolerances and uncertainties). Specifically, scientists in India, working on global issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and other environmental issues need to be given greater agency to communicate their findings to influence foreign policies, which might affect our country. A study from 2011 found that Europe and North America dominate participation in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (73%). 45% of countries have never contributed as authors in the IPCC process.\nTherefore, in order to understand the impact of science policies on our research and infleunce them, scientists must be a critical observer of the discourse. Questions about policy—both local and global— should be discussed such as: What are the major science policies in India? What are the internal and external politics shaping them? What does the removal of the DEI policy in the U.S. or its withdrawal from WHO mean to research and development and public health in India? Were these policy decisions made in consultation with scientists? How are climate deals impacting India’s research system? How can research in our labs contribute to policy-making? Science policy 101 must be part of the science education curriculum. At the very least, the discourse around science policies should be given more space and time in classrooms and labs. There is a close interlinkage between science and politics—science we do shapes the foreign policies, and the policies shape the science we do. Science is an individual pursuit, yes, but it is also international and collaborative.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-06-foreign-policy-op-ed-01/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAs a student of science and education at a government college, I had no encouragement to keep up with current affairs.

In 2021, two Asiatic Bear cubs were found on the Pakistani side of Kashmir. Unable to open their eyes, the cubs could barely manage to crawl away from the border. Their mother? She was never to be found on the Pakistani side; she was probably killed at the Indian border, either due to the fencing or landmines. The long-standing disputes between India and Pakistan have led to the two countries taking extreme measures; the electric fence being one of them. The fencing of the Line Of Control (LoC) completed in 2004 was meant to prevent the illegal entry of militants. But it has inadvertently also caused incredible damage to habitats at the border—spanning cold deserts, mountains and hot deserts. Locals and forest officials on both sides of the border recount countless stories of lost wildlife—such as separated cubs, deer injured by landmines, or leopards killed for human safety—all as a direct consequence of border control and fencing. But who is to listen? Both countries are too busy strategising their next wars or attacks.\nAsiatic Bears are one of many threatened border species. Recent data indicates that 82% of global border hotspots for threatened transboundary species are located in Asia. With the global biodiversity loss rate being 100 times greater than the baseline, I believe that it is high time that India and Pakistan—two Asian countries with moderately high transboundary biodiversity—collaborate and initiate dialogue for this pressing need for conservation. However, a study determining the feasibility of the conservation of these species, published in Nature Ecology and Evolution, gave the India-Pakistan border a low feasibility score. The border scored lower in collaboration and shared governance between the two countries, and higher on human pressure due to ongoing conflicts and war activities. With over three wars fought between the two countries in the 77 years of their existence, the India-Pakistan border is one of the most militarized zones in the world. Conflicts and attacks have long neglected biodiversity, leading to habitat fragmentation (particularly for territorial animals), disrupted migration, destruction of habitats, and even inadvertent killings of animals. Furthermore, the lack of research and conservation activities in these regions only exacerbates the problem at hand, as the lack of data de-incentivises the countries from taking action. While attempting to find research on prior conservation activities, I was disappointed by this research gap. A researcher studying Markhor (Pakistan’s national animal) on the Indian side of Kashmir in an interview with a Turkish public broadcaster said “Most of the time security might [ask] you, ‘why are you contacting these people [in Pakistan]?’. Initially, the situation there [in Jammu and Kashmir] was so bad that I was sort of afraid to contact people from Pakistan.” This distrust between the officials and people further threatens the endangered species.\nHow have other Asian countries handled conservational efforts at their borders? Going back to the feasibility index study, we find a positive example of cooperation leading to better conservation. One of the richest biodiversity hotspots, the island of Bruneo, occupied by Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei, has managed to preserve the interiors of the island through legally binding government commitments. One could argue that these three countries have been generally cordial to each other making it easier to collaborate. However, are there examples of countries collaborating on biodiversity conservation despite a history of disputes?\nThe Demilitarised Zone between the two Koreas is an extreme example, where fear inadvertently has led to conservation. A narrow strip at the borders, 4 kilometres wide and 250 kilometres across, with very minimal human inhabitants for the past 70 years, has become a biodiversity-rich region in Korea. Estimates by South Korea suggest that the region is home to more than 5000 species including 100 that are protected. However, the region is still fenced and guarded. Paradoxically, the only reason why the Demilitarized zone is not yet exploited is the fear of war and conflicts rather than peace declarations. Beyond Asia, in conflicted areas such as Israel and Palestine, researchers are trying to collaborate to minimise the effects of war on biodiversity. Recently this March, as reported by Nature, researchers from Israel and Palestine came together to study the potential for barn owls to reduce pesticide use in agriculture, after the ceasefire was declared.\nGiven the urgency biodiversity loss—accelerated further by climate change, pollution and other challenges—it is crucial for Pakistan and India to come together to address the issue. I propose that the two countries take these three crucial steps, taking into consideration the existing differences: define peace parks at the boundaries, continue ceasefires, and exercise empathy. Peace Parks are “a clearly defined geographical space that consists of protected areas that are ecologically connected across one or more international boundaries and involve some form of cooperation”. Researchers\u0026rsquo; top recommendation for this is Siachen (mountain glacier region in the Himalayas) which is home to snow leopards and a place where tributaries of Indus merge. Siachen Peace Park would help conserve snow leopards while preventing the water pollution presently being caused by the armies. Similarly, the countries could also recognise certain flagship species to draw the attention of political leaders and concerned people. Experts have identified five species corresponding to five ecological epochs found at the India-Pakistan border. This includes Snow Leopards from the Trans-Himalayan region, Kashmir Markhor in the Himalayan region, Bar-headed Goose in the Semi-Arid region, Great Indian Bustard in the Desert region, and Indian Wild Ass in the Rann of Kutch. Peace Park could also signal the beginning of a peaceful relationship between India and Pakistan.\nCeasefires, on the other hand, can have immediate benefits to the ecosystem. For instance, the ceasefire reinforcement in 2022 led to an additional 15 migratory bird species (alongside usual visitors such as bar-headed goose) being seen in the Gharana wetland region. Additionally, removal of landmines would prevent unnecessary deaths of animals. Although exact damages are unknown, both the Russia-Ukraine and the Israel-Palestine conflicts have shown the devastating impacts of war on biodiversity, which should become a lesson for all countries in conflict including India and Pakistan to not go into wars in future. Finally, exercise empathy and compassion for fellow humans and individuals of other species. Empathy at a people-to-people level and at the diplomatic level would go a long way with conservation efforts. A simple recollection in our collective conscious of bear cubs separated from their mother because of a human-made fenced border is enough to remind ourselves of devastating consequences of borders on wildlife. Countries are constructs of humans; no other species defines boundaries in their habitats. Impositions of our boundaries cannot have spillover effects. Therefore, countries must make peace to co-exist with fellow species on the planet. Animals like Asiatic bears at the India-Pakistan border should be able to move freely, claiming back all their territory, and living their regular lives. India and Pakistan might be divided by their conflict over land acquisition, however, they must come together to give back the very same land to ones that equally are part of the planet: wildlife.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-06-foreign-policy-op-ed-02/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e“Twin orphaned bear cubs given shelter near India-Pakistan border”, read a Reuters News headline.

I found Social History fascinating because it weaves together the lived experiences of people from the past. What piqued my interest was how there are certain culminating events in history—such as the Beveridge Report becoming popular—but the event in itself does not tell us the whole story. It is only when we situate that event in the mundane of every day and look at the ideas of the time, does the real picture of the past emerges. In that regard, I was drawn to the work of journalist Charles Madge, the anthropologist Tom Harrisson, and the filmmaker Humphrey Jennings in documenting the “Collective unconscious” through “Mass-Observations”. In particular, there was this statement on why British people, particularly middle-class people, were having smaller families than they had in the past, which read: “People lacked faith in the future. Not a belief that things are going to be tough, and it will take a long time to get right \u0026hellip; But a belief that nobody’s going to try and put things right and improve them, that the nation is going to muddle on through the chaoses [sic] of another 1919–39 to another world war in 1965.”\nDid this collective unconscious influence Beveridge when he wrote his report, when he proposed his new imagination for a welfare state, or when he said, “Bread for all before cake for anybody”? I believe so. It also made me wonder, what is the collective unconscious of the present India? Is there still a doomist perspective on life, in general? The first thought that came to me was climate change. I cannot speak for all, but at least in urban spaces, there is growing climate anxiety as extreme weather events become more frequent. I have heard some friends say they do not want to have kids because they worry the world might not be a conducive place to live. Access to healthcare—which is, in part, also influenced by climate change—is still a major concern, too. However, on second thought, I realised that the existence of the internet and social media might influence the collective unconscious. Maybe if one can sift through the polarised debates, misinformation and hoaxes, an understanding of the collective unconscious emerges. Or perhaps studying these polarised debates itself gives us a pulse for what society is thinking about?\nIt is still interesting to ponder how might this collective unconscious influence the functioning of society. How, if at all, might it influence the welfare state?

Our team’s table read of the National Policy for Rare Diseases (NPRD), 2021, exposed me to the intricacies of India’s present-day healthcare system. We had extensive discussions about how essential services—such as genetic counseling, newborn screening, and early detection of non-communicable diseases—should be part of the Primary Health Care (PHC) system. Adding to these conversations was The India Forum article, Right to Healthcare in Times of Universal Health Coverage, which gave me a framework to think about and possibly reimagine the healthcare system.\nGuided by the pillars of the healthcare framework—Right to Healthcare and Universal Health Coverage—the article argues “for states to reorient and reorganize their health systems, consciously and foundationally based on a comprehensive primary healthcare approach.” Although I am speaking for an edge case of rare genetic diseases, the comprehensive approach is essential to ensure equitable healthcare for patients. For example, if PHCs are equipped, both in terms of knowledge and resources, to diagnose rare genetic diseases (RGDs) in patients, it would significantly reduce the average diagnosis period (currently seven years) and ensure equitable access to treatment, which would not be restricted to affluent individuals. Therefore, we cannot have PHCs that only “cover some aspects of reproductive health services and a few disease control programs while the rest are left to private markets.”\nThe article highlights challenges with the pillars themselves. Health rights are liable to be used to expand the entitlements of the rich, and universal coverage has come to be predominantly associated with public financing of private provision and big pharma rather than strengthening public health systems to ensure access for all. This critical point made me question who the actual beneficiaries of universal coverage and health rights are. I know of certain Patient Advocacy Groups (PAGs) fighting in court to secure the insufficient ₹20 lakhs promised by NPRD for their children. However, the article highlights the other side of the coin, where “pharmaceutical companies have been found to have had an active role in bringing right to health cases to court.” Are these health schemes emulating a sort of cash transfer between the government and big private entities?\nFinally, the questions I am left with are: How do we prioritise building a comprehensive primary health care system, when there are resource constraints and advantage-seekers? How do we define rights and coverage in a way that closes these gaps and ensures that the welfare state benefits only its citizens?\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-06-the-welfare-state-critical-notes-01/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAt my previous workplace, I was involved in public health communication for rare genetic diseases.

I am starting to get anxious about the interview. But I need to keep at it. I have also reached out to two scholars. Fingers crossed.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/week-33/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"2025-03-03-to-2025-03-09\"\u003e2025-03-03 to 2025-03-09\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerm 06 has begun.

However, I have not been able to give these courses the time they deserve because of climate and WSCI presentations.

After returning, I was immersed into a block-taught course called Visual Storytelling and Cinematic Techniques. Looking back, it was a very useful course. I, for the first time, learnt video production and acting. From direction insights such as camera angles, shot types, cutaways, continuity, to technicalities of video editing\u0026mdash;we learnt it all. Naturally, the classes were quite intense, packed from morning to evening. Additionally, our ELM had added responsibilities of preparing for the India Science Festival, where we were showcasing the board game version of Pralay. I still remember those cold and gloomy winter evenings, when I forced myself to get out of my room to meet the team to discuss the logistics of making the game. It all came together at the very last moment.\nGoing to the India Science Festival, Fergusson College, Pune (2025-01-11 to 2025-01-14) I was such a chaos by the time India Science Festival came. I was unwell and burnt out. It was evident to others, too. For example, I forgot to take my laptop out at security. I kept obsessing that I had forgotten to pack the game tokens. I was also getting used to travelling with people, the last time I did that was back in May 2023 (Delhi Hackathon :P). The first night stay was a misery. We had booked a shady hotel, where cockroaches and other insects greeted us. Luckily, I convinced my team to book a better hotel for the next two days, and that made for a better Pune experience.\nRunning the India Science Festival booth was such an experience. We had so many people pouring in. We estimated that around 500 people played the game over the two days. I felt a bit useless because I could not speak Hindi. I am also not a people-person, I realised. However, the team did brilliantly, engaging the audience, keeping them captive. There were caveats, but it was one of my peak science communication moments of all time.\nMet some famiiar people and made some new acquaintances. The highlight was meeting Tuttu. I am so glad I met her despite how busy and tired I was.\nTerm 05 (2025-01-15 to 2025-02-19) Prof. Vijay and Prof. Butalia I started the next term immediately after returning from Pune. I was quite excited for Prof. Vijay\u0026rsquo;s first class and he did not disappoint. Along with his course on Climate and Geopolitics, we also had a course on Women, Society and Chaning India taught by Prof. Urvashi Butalia. YIF normalises having professors who are stalwarts in their fields. Where else in India do you get to take two courses by Padma Shri awardees in the same term?\nHowever, as fate would have it, I fell sick. A really bad case of stomach flu (it could have been a bacterial infection, too, I will never know). I lost almost 15 days of January to it. As a result, I lost touch with the courses. Prof. Vijay\u0026rsquo;s class got too political unlike the first class on developmental biology and evolution, and Prof. Butalia\u0026rsquo;s classes were not accessible due to my lack of familiarity with the discourse.\nFriends of YIF As the term 05 progressed, we got really busy with Friends of YIF, a live production hosted annually by all Fellows. It was one of the few things I looked forward to at the YIF. I gave my name for classical music and the end-performance. Overall, it was fun working on the performance. Learning a new keerthane took me back to my school days. It also made me realise how rusty my singing and knowledge has become. The rehearsals were intense and long. Never would I have imagined myself sleeping at 0200 for consecutive nights. As always, it all came together and the performance turned out great. It was livestreamed on YouTube and my family enjoyed my performance as well. Honestly, I was a tad bit upset that I did not get a solo performance, but I learnt a lot by working with the team.\nGood News After the Friends of YIF, we were back to Term 05 classes. Exactly a week later, as I was about to go to sleep on the 14th of Feb., I got an email from Chevening. I was in disbelief reading \u0026ldquo;Congratulations\u0026rdquo; in the title of the email. I had been shortlisted for the interview! Just when I was about to give up on my dream to do Masters in Science Communication. To celebrate, I managed to sneak in a visit to Delhi. Arushi and I visited Humayun\u0026rsquo;s Tomb and marvelled at Islamic Geometric Patterns. It was a fun day out.\nELM Immersion Week (2025-02-20 to 2025-03-01) The immersion was not so stressful. We worked mainly on design of the board game and aesthetic. Slow but steady progress. Nothing too fancy. I tried but failed preparing for Chevening. I also tried drafting my Inlaks application, and could not make much progress on it either. It is what it is.\nThat covers it all, I think. It took me roughly an hour to write, not too bad. Not many images to add. Might find some later.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/week-23-to-32/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI meant to write more frequently, however, it seems like I have not managed to be disciplined enough yet again.

The papers were technical, however, I knew enough scientific jargon to grasp the apocalypse predicted. One of the papers read, “under RCP8.5, a small fraction of the South Asian population (~4%) is projected to experience TWmax [maximum wet bulb temperature] exceeding 35°C by 2100. However, approximately 75% of the population is projected to experience TWmax exceeding 31°C, considered dangerous levels for most humans…” (Im et al.). This made me wonder: Are the people living in the regions-to-be-affected aware of the future they are about to face, let alone be prepared? Worse, “the geographical locations of the most extreme projected heat waves in the Indus and Ganges river valleys coincide largely with locations of highly vulnerable human populations in terms of population density, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and agricultural intensity” (Im et al.). How does one even talk about future projections when these vulnerable communities have more immediate problems of livelihood and survival to deal with in the present?\nThis made me realise that while climate science, politics, and diplomacy are complex, communicating complexities to a diverse audience is a problem in itself.\nApproaching the Problem of Communication Putting myself in the shoes of a communicator equipped with accurate scientific information on wet bulb temperatures, I listed my potential challenges I might face in having a dialogue with an Indian audience:\nDo my audience members have the same perspective and knowledge as me? Considering their priorities, backgrounds, beliefs, and ideologies, why should they be interested in and trust my message? How can I explain this concept while maintaining its complexities without resorting to technical jargon? Furthermore, how can I address the linguistic diversity present in the Indian population? To understand how to address these challenges, I set out on running an experimentation and reading marathon. Mini-Ethnographic Study to Know the Audience: Asking ‘what do you know about climate change?’ Addressing the first challenge. Over a week, I asked every person I interacted with one question: What do you know about climate change? By every person, I mean my roommate, my father, my best friend, my colleagues, the housekeeping didi, the reception didi, the printer bhaiya—whomever I met.\nThe motivation to ask this question was simple. We assume that almost everyone of us would have heard about climate change. While that is majorly true, what they understand of it varies significantly. Take for example, my roommate. She says climate change is increasing in global temperature and change in weather patterns, and is happening because of ozone depletion caused by carbon dioxide emissions. On the other hand, my best friend attributed climate change to pollution and deforestation. Although some of what they said was in the right direction, none of them understood what climate change meant—the long-term shifts in the global average temperature and weather patterns due to human activities, mainly carbon emissions. There was also a tendency to muddle other related issues such as pollution, deforestation, urbanisation, along with climate change.\nWhen I asked the same question to people who may not have had exposure to formal education, the responses were different. The receptionist didi said she had heard of Jalwayu parivartan in school, but she did not remember what it meant. The housekeeping didi, on the other hand, had never heard of climate change at all.\nSince I brought up climate change in conversations without prior notice, which might have taken people aback or made them conscious, the inferences from this mini-ethnographic study of mine should be approached with caution. However, it is still true that people’s responses varied diversely. Yale’s Program on Climate Change Communication reports that “54% say they know either ‘just a little’ about global warming or have never heard of it, while only 10% say they know ‘a lot.’” (“Climate Change in the Indian Mind, 2023”). Of course, this is not to call anybody stupid or ignorant. In fact, all the people I spoke to were experts/skilled in their own fields. Therefore, the fundamental problem of communication is, given the varying degree of climate change knowledge, how does one communicate a more relatively complex concept such as wet bulb temperature?\nOne possible solution would be having skilled and trained communicators initiate by first ‘knowing their audience’ and then contextualising the explanation of the concept. Furthermore, asking audience questions to prompt them to recall their lived experiences helps, too. For example, I asked many folks if they had experienced extreme weather events. My roommate brought up the unnatural winters in her hometown and the receptionist didi spoke about a 1995 natural disaster in Haryana. Building on this experience to explain anthropogenic climate change consequences would become relatively easier in most cases.\nHowever, gauging the audience’s prior factual knowledge is the first step. While engaging, a communicator has to navigate the attitudes about climate change, which is shaped by various socio-political factors. This leads us to the second challenge.\nNarratives about Climate Change: Influence of people’s beliefs, values, and ideologies In a country as diverse as India, attitudes are shaped by factors such as geographical location, religion, belief systems, literacy, and political views. Naturally, it is challenging for communicators to understand the specific socio-political background their audience comes from. Since research shows that people need to understand climate change as a narrative, containing their own language and shaped by their own values and experience, how can one effectively ground themselves to their audience?\nAfter conducting a literature review and parsing through many climate communication research based in the Global North, I finally found a report by Climate Outreach containing India-specific recommendations to weave climate narratives. In their report on Communicating Climate Change in India, they document “the language around climate change and renewables that speaks best to the values and identity of people across India—a country chosen because of its critical importance in the world of climate change. [The report] explores the attitudes of a wide range of people: urban professionals, remote farmers, people of progressive and conservative political values, and the young people who will determine the future of the country.” (One drawback is that the research participants are all from North India.)\nSome interesting recommendations from the report (Communicating Climate Change in India) that caught my attention were:\nReflect national pride in India as a country that is overcoming challenges and on a journey of improvement. Present climate change as damaging our connection with nature. Use concern about pollution as the key entry point for starting the public conversation. (stress the distinct role of carbon pollution in causing climate change. Present fossil fuels as polluting (rather than \u0026ldquo;dirty\u0026rdquo;), finite and imported. By contrast, present renewable energy as clean, unlimited and a proof of Indian self-reliance. Place renewables within a wider narrative of Indian natural abundance and diversity. Not to mention, climate change communication has become even more difficult in the digital post-truth era, where the information diet of people is restricted to their echo chambers. Combined with the socio-political factors, digital information spaces have become a fertile ground for myths, misinformation, and conspiracy theories to propagate. Therefore, as mentioned by Dr Ashish Jha (Dean of the Brown University School of Public Health) in a recent talk at Ashoka University, there is a greater need for communicators and researchers to go out of their science echo chambers and engage with that of, say, conservatives, or religious leaders, and have an empathetic and open dialogue about socio-scientific issues such as climate change.\nThe Language Finally, the challenge of language. India is linguistically diverse with 122 languages and several dialects (“Protecting Language Diversity in India”). However, when it comes to terms related to climate change, there are no direct translations. Even if translations exist, they are not colloquially known. In my case, not knowing fluent Hindi, I ran into an issue explaining to the housekeeping didi about climate change. Eventually, I resorted to using an AI tool to translate the definition of climate change to aid my conversation with her. Similarly, I tried to write about climate change in my native language—Kannada—and failed miserably. Since the communities vulnerable to experiencing maximum wet bulb temperatures are not English-speaking background, there is a greater need for more regional language communicators in India who can balance the complexities of climate change without using obscure native language phrases.\nHowever, even while communicating in English, there are several hurdles. Often, as communicators, one has to think about the framing of explanations and nuances to omit in order to avoid information overload. It is also essential to communicate uncertainties in the scientific understandings without leading to unhealthy doubt in the scientific process. One useful tactic is to shift from an ‘uncertainty’ to a ‘risk’ framing, which also makes it easier for people to weigh up the costs and benefits of inaction, rather than getting stuck in the perception that knowledge is still imperfect (Corner et al.). For example, “approximately 75% of the population is projected to experience TWmax exceeding 31°C, considered dangerous levels for most humans…”, the risk is directly communicated impactfully.\nConclusion Fig. (B to D) The spatial distributions of bias-corrected ensemble averaged 30-year TWmax for each GHG scenario: HIST (1976–2005) (B), RCP4.5 (2071–2100) (C), and RCP8.5 (2071–2100) (D) (Im et al.). I would like to end the essay with these maps predicting a hot and humid future. They show that almost all of India would experience maximum wet bulb temperature at least once if the emissions are not curbed or only moderately mitigated (Im et al.). I cannot help but stare at this grim future and feel frustrated that not many people in my country know what the future holds for generations to come. However, a slow but steady progress towards dialogue-based open climate communication in the Indian context, backed by social science research offers hope. Modifying this famous quote by Sir Mark Walport (ex-director of Wellcome Trust UK), “Science is not complete until it is communicated”, I would say the climate crisis will never be solved until it is communicated.\nWorks Cited “Climate Change in the Indian Mind, 2023.” Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-indian-mind-2023/toc/2/.\nCommunicating Climate Change in India. climatenetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/climate_outreach_can_-_global_narratives_india4.pdf.

December was indeed an interesting curveball I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting.\n2024-12-22 The last day of Organizational Dynamics. It started at 0930. The lectures were boring, honestly. In the afternoon, we were given the final group assignment to express our learnings from the course through a creative piece. Although I was initially hesitant, I ended up dancing with the group. It was definitely a memorable experience, and I am super grateful to my team.\nThe day became exhausting as we continued with lectures and the final activity of expressing gratitude to each other. The class became incredibly noisy, which made me leave earlier. I also had to pack to go back home. Packing didn’t take as long. Pravin was around as I packed, so it wasn’t a boring activity either. However, the worst part came when I couldn’t sleep. I had dreamed of going home almost every day since the second month of staying at Ashoka. The day had finally arrived... Going back home\u0026hellip; 2024-12-23 I woke up at 0430 and got out of bed at 0515. I was pooling a cab with a fellow Fellow, Jahnavi. My flight was at 11:45. We reached Delhi airport surprisingly early at 0715. After security, I stopped by Carnatic Cafe for Masale Dose. It was yum. After a quick round of shopping, I napped for a bit before heading to my gate. The flight ride was quiet. I only regretted not getting my neck pillow. But my anticipation of returning home made me restless, and I wouldn’t have slept well anyway.\nAfter landing, I felt overjoyed reading \u0026ldquo;Bengaluru Airport\u0026rdquo; written in Kannada. As I stepped out and took my first breath, I couldn’t help but smile under my mask. Distance does make you grow fonder of your homeland.\nI was staying in Bangalore for a night, and Adrian had booked a guest room for me at the BLiSc campus. After having a delightful small talk in Kannada with the cab driver, I made it to the inSTEM gate and was greeted by Adrian.\nI freshened up and left to meet my TIGS colleagues. Coincidentally, it was one of my colleagues\u0026rsquo; send-offs. I got to meet everyone at the same time and also send her off. I spent about 15 minutes later looking at the progress on some of the projects I had started. I was happy to see that they were being taken forward. Adrian seemed super busy, so I met Vishal at C-CAMP instead. He was the annoying person he always is, but there was some comfort in seeing his familiar face. He gave me a couple of chocolate bars (which came in handy later when I traveled to my grandparents\u0026rsquo; place).\nFinally, I went over to NCBS. Adrian was talking to his PI, and I went off to wander. I bumped into Chandrani, my ex-roommate. She was taken aback, as expected. We also met baby Shaon on the way. At the canteen, I met Siddharth and Shreekant. Meeting people one after another made me realize that I actually know a lot of these people! Even the canteen staff recognized me :)\nOver dinner, we mostly spoke about the YIF, interspersed with other folks describing their work. I retired to my room after dinner and dozed off.\nAdrian woke me up. I went over to his Naidile room. It was beautifully curated :) I wish I had photographed it. We spent some time talking, and he played the bass guitar. We also played a game of UNO (I lost, hehe). I came back to my room and slept.\n2024-12-24 I woke up early the next morning despite being tired. I went over to the medical shop nearby for essentials. All of the previous day, I had used dish soap to wash my hands. I showered, journaled, and left to have breakfast at C-CAMP. It was nostalgic because the only time I had breakfast there was on my joining day. Over breakfast, we spoke about Adrian\u0026rsquo;s experiment.\nI went on a quick Archives tour. They had an exhibit on the Green Revolution. I met Siddharth at the Acad canteen next. We had a useful discussion about the current status of science communication in India and a potential abstract for the critical writing conference.\nI went back to InSTEM for lunch with Adrian and then left. On my way, I had an argument with Karthik about a comment I had made the previous day. It wasn’t fun.

I also did some reading: The Philosophy of Science book, Siddharth\u0026rsquo;s paper on scientific temper, and The Art of Statistics book. I also tried to do some writing, but was unable to.\nAfter entering the Western Ghats, the views became more scenic, and all I did was look out. I also really needed to pee, but the washroom smelled awful. My kaaka was late by 45 minutes in picking me up, which made me slightly annoyed. We ate at a local restaurant (my anxiety went through the roof). We went to the market for some shopping before heading to Kadnamane, my paternal grandparents\u0026rsquo; place.\nI greeted all my family members, freshened up, spent time learning more about my youngest cousin (who is now 2 years old). I was pleasantly surprised by how well the internet worked there. I could speak to anybody!\nArushi got really curious about life in villages and bombarded me with so many questions.

The course has given me the vocabulary and framework to describe and critique functioning of groups. I particularly liked learning about paradoxes in group dynamics and watching groups forming and dying.\nCareer-wise, the main highlights were talking to Prof. Vijayraghavan and Prof. Usha Raman about my career. I am a lot more optimistic thanks to their advice and encouragement. Not to jinx, but I might have chance of building a career in science communication afterall.\nAmidst all this, I managed to attend Secret Santa evening, my first social event after the open mic.

The subsequent day, after his talk, I met him again at 0700 in the morning. Being around him was such a delight to say the least. With me were Makerspace folks and two students from his frugal science course. They steered the conversation around open hardware. I could not contribute much.

Before he left, he handed all of us a Foldscope.\nThe final classes of Economics and The New Geography of Information Age felt anti-climatic. I am, however, going to miss both the professors.\nLater in the week, we presented the board game version of our game, Pralay. Preparing for it took a lot of our time, we spent an hour or so everyday leading up it. Thankfully, the hardwork paid off. The demo went well and we got positive feedback.\nFinally, I spent the weekend coding with Prawin. We are trying to understand discourse around vaccine in YouTube comments. Getting YouTube API and a Large Language Model working to get comments and do a sentiment analysis has been quite the task, but we have made some progress.\nP.S.

At first glance, one might argue that removing non-factual content, such as \u0026ldquo;vaccines cause autism\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;plant X has proven to cure Y disease,\u0026rdquo; might be the best option to prevent its further spread. However, the problem is that non-factual content is complicated and takes many forms—misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories—all of which require different approaches to address.\nFor example, if someone claims that vaccines cause autism, it is important to recognize that they are basing their argument on a scientific paper that was once published and later retracted. This brings me to my first point: contrary to society’s perception of science as a collection of facts, the power of science lies in its uncertainty. When researchers publish a finding, they attach a specific uncertainty to it. This means that when presented with sufficient evidence, that finding can be refuted. For an observer, science correcting itself to make progress might sound confusing; what was once considered a fact may no longer be a fact. Therefore, improving scientific literacy should be at the heart of combating misinformation caused by a lack of understanding of scientific processes. Censorship does not address this.\nCensorship also leads to another problem: it pushes misinformation into “harder-to-reach corners of the internet.” My preliminary research on vaccine misinformation on YouTube suggests that non-factual anti-vaccine content has become harder to find compared to a few years ago. But when you dig deeper into the comments, you find anti-vaccine content. Therefore, censorship is not directly leading to the anti-vaccine community becoming smaller; they are still present, but they no longer immediately appear in mainstream social media search results. In some sense, this is good because there is a reduced chance of a user stumbling upon a misinformation post by chance. However, this is my second point: it also makes it harder to address the issue of misinformation itself, as it continues to propagate within its echo chambers.\nDisinformation and conspiracy theories, such as “the Earth is flat,” “climate change is not real,” and “5G causes the spread of coronavirus,” are among the most complex types of non-factual content to deal with. In these cases, there are people at extremes, and what gets censored directly influences the discourse about the issue.\nWhat should we be doing to combat non-factual information, then? Researchers suggest that there should be open, transparent discussions, which need to be fostered by social media platforms. Fact-checking, done both at individual and organizational levels, plays a crucial role in carefully debunking arguments and thereby ensuring a balanced conversation. There also needs to be trust built between scientific organizations and citizens. Algorithms, too, can be modified in such a manner that misinformation once flagged appears less often on people’s feeds, thereby limiting its reach. Circling back to the process of science, conversations on social media about science should also involve a back-and-forth, where users use the latest evidence while making claims.\nWorks Cited “Royal Society Cautions against Censorship of Scientific Misinformation Online | Royal Society.” Royalsociety.org, 19 Jan. 2022, royalsociety.org/news/2022/01/scientific-misinformation-report/.

I cried a lot after realizing that, unlike previous years, I had nothing nice to say about 2024. The birthday celebrations were decent. I watched a movie with Arushi, drank Keventers (thanks, Anushka), ate pasta, got quite a few gifts (really grateful to Arushi, Anushka, Pravin, and Adrian), had two mini cake cuttings, and the class sang \u0026ldquo;Happy Birthday.\u0026rdquo; Hopefully, next year, I will be slightly happier.\nHappy birthday poster on my door (by Arushi)\nKeventers (by Anushka)\nPost-birthday gift (by Arushi again)\nThe India Science Festival and Pralay Board Game When our Self-Designed Experiential Learning Module got approved, we applied for a booth space at the India Science Festival (ISF). In the second week of November, we were interviewed by the organizers. A few days ago, we learned that we had been selected! I am super excited to finally attend the ISF after wanting to do so for 3 years. The team has spent many hours developing the board game version for the booth. Hopefully, it will be ready by the end of December. The event is on the 11th and 12th of January in Pune, again :)\nThe team brainstorming the details of the board game\nEssays and Quizzes This semester has had less group work and more individual assignments, which I am enjoying. So far, I have written 6 essays for NGIA and completed 2 quizzes for Economics.\nThe NGIA course is not as fun as I thought it would be. It feels very scattered, making it hard for me to fully absorb everything the professor talks about. However, I have been introduced to blockchain, zero-knowledge proofs, surveillance on the internet, rabbit holes, echo chambers, and so on. Economics, on the other hand, has been insightful. Learning about a new discipline in an organized fashion is the best kind of learning joy I can ever experience. Prof. Shiv Kumar delivers that. Of course, microeconomics has its limitations (just like a physicist\u0026rsquo;s spherical cow), but it is still useful to learn the basic principles being taught.\nI did not enjoy doing the Critical Writing Ethnographic study and report. Maybe it was the topic, the timing, or the team—I can\u0026rsquo;t pinpoint it. I\u0026rsquo;m glad it\u0026rsquo;s over, and we finally managed to submit something satisfactory.\nOther Tidbits I have been reading quite a bit: Palestine by Joe Sacco, Big Data by Dawn E. Holmes, Philosophy of Science by Samir Okasha, Evolution and Tinkering by François Jacob, Critical Theory, many articles for NGIA essays, and the list goes on. I attended a 3D printing Makerspace event. It was my first time with the machine. I enjoyed it but was disappointed that I didn\u0026rsquo;t get a chance to make a 3D printed object myself. I also learned about the RepRap Movement. At a student-led performance, I heard acoustic violin for the first time since I stopped playing. It made me emotional.

One such event was registering for our Aadhar cards. One day after school, my parents and I went to a registration center near the famous temple in the town. I had no idea what Aadhar was, and my parents did not explain it either. It was a small shop with benches, and it was unusually crowded. As a jumpy 10-year-old, I did not want to wait. Hours passed. When our turn finally came, I realized why the process took so long: the biometrics. People had to try multiple times before their biometrics were recorded. Of course, this was in the early days, somewhere around 2010, and the process, I am sure, is a lot smoother now.\nYears passed, and I slowly witnessed how the Aadhar card became a ubiquitous requisite, for schooling to traveling. By class 6 or 7, the school mandated a photocopy of Aadhar to be submitted. For entrance exams, Aadhar was the popular choice. Next, the college wanted one. When I went to the bank to create my account, I submitted a copy again. Finally, I produced my Aadhar to get all my other documents done—Passport, PAN card, and Driver’s License. I continue to use Aadhar to travel. This is the story of millions of us who grew up post-Aadhar.\nAadhar has just always been there. It is hard to conceive a world without it. However, until recently, I had not critically thought about the role Aadhar plays in our lives. Reading a blog by Yale, I learned that thanks to Aadhar, “Banks and mobile phone companies have enrolled poor people who previously had been seen as too risky and cost-prohibitive to be viable customers.” It also prevented ration supplies from being diverted by the corrupt. On the other hand, Aadhar also opened up the issue of who owns biometric and private data. With all bank, school, and other related data linked to your Aadhar, it is not inconceivable to link the data with your behavior to surveil you. The Right to Privacy is now a Fundamental Right, but is it enough to stop the government and other stakeholders from harnessing your data? It is not clear.\nAs the blog points out, a pushback against Aadhar also comes from those who were threatened by the fact that it might reveal their private economic activity. This was mainly felt by the rich or fraudsters, who could be looking to use “concern for the masses as a means to sabotage a program that they want to get rid of.”\nHowever, life without Aadhar is presently inconceivable. Although not mandatory on paper, availing many private and most government services requires you to have Aadhar. As discussed by Kiran Jonnalagadda in his article “Life Without Aadhar,” creating a bank account, filing tax returns, and buying property—all these activities are incredibly difficult to accomplish without possessing Aadhar. There have even been cases where medical care was denied in the absence of an Aadhar card.\nTo conclude, I feel there needs to be more transparency from the government and UIDAI regarding what happens to the data. Alternatives to not having an Aadhar card should be spelled out more clearly when services are being availed. There also needs to be more awareness among the public, especially when there are people like me who sometimes accept impositions without question.\nWorks Cited Jonnalagadda, Kiran. “Life without Aadhaar.” Deccan Herald, 20 Sept. 2024, www.deccanherald.com/india/life-without-aadhaar-3200235.

Prof. Debayan’s descriptions of patients behaving oddly after their callosotomy—a procedure disconnecting the two halves of the brain—made me probe further.\nSearching YouTube landed me on the most popular video on this topic by the CGP Grey channel. It described the experiments conducted in the late 19th century on split-brain patients by Sperry et al., which revealed the different specializations of the left and right hemispheres of the brain, a phenomenon known as lateralization. However, I found certain phrasings in the video questionable. Specifically, it claimed that “you are two,” meaning that there are two separate minds in an individual—the linguistic “left brain” and visual-processing “right brain.” It speculates that, in non-split-brain individuals, the “right brain rose up as a companion without a choice.” The video ends with a deeply unsettling thought: “At this moment, in your normal head, there are two of you watching this video: one having a \u0026lsquo;mind-blown\u0026rsquo; moment, and the other mentally rolling its eyes at the obviousness of it all.” I found this perspective—that there are two separate conscious agents—somewhat misinterpreting the experiments.\nOn probing further about split-brain experiments, I found a video essay (about two hours long) by a science communication channel called The Art of Deduction, debunking CGP Grey’s video. This video essay brought out the nuances missed by CGP Grey. First, the need to use “hemispheres” instead of “brains” to refer to the two parts of the brain. Second, pointing out that a callosotomy does not mean that your brain is completely split in two, as this ignores other connections and parts of the brain. Third, showcasing that CGP Grey’s video is based on an early paper about a former army personnel, whose brain injury might have exaggerated the effects of the surgical procedure. Quoting a research study by Pinto et al., which said, “canonical textbook findings that a split-brain patient can only respond to stimuli in the left visual half-field with the left hand, and to stimuli in the right visual half-field with the right hand and verbally, are not universally true,” the video essay emphasized the differential response to the surgery by individuals. Pinto et al.’s paper indicates that “severing the cortical connections between hemispheres splits visual perception, but does not create two independent conscious perceivers within one brain.”\nIn conclusion, CGP Grey’s video was yet another example of oversimplification gone wrong. This criticism of the implication of split-brain experiment results does not undermine the fact that split-brain experiments are fascinating to watch. For example, there are perplexing videos where these patients are able to draw two separate shapes simultaneously with their left and right hands. However, it is also important to note that many of these quirks seen in the patients cannot be generalized.\nWork Cited Pinto, Y., Neville, D.A., Otten, M., Corballis, P.M., Lamme, V.A.F., Haan, E.H.F., Foschi, N., Fabri, M.

Decades of research show that vaccines save lives. However, there are communities of people known as anti-vaxxers who hesitate or refuse to get vaccinated. When faced with devastating pandemics like COVID-19, this \u0026ldquo;vaccine hesitancy\u0026rdquo; poses a threat to humanity. The advent of social media has only complicated the issue, providing opportunities for anti-vaxxers to spread misinformation.\nAs part of the Extension Notes, I looked at YouTube comments on:\nA short video about the rare side effects of COVID-19 vaccines by a news channel. An explainer video about the side effects of vaccines by a science communication channel. The goal was to explore the ratio of pro-vaccinators to anti-vaxxers in the comments for these videos. A natural assumption would be that the news video on rare side effects would attract more anti-vaxxers than the explainer. This also means that viewers of explainers are more likely to be the ones who already trust vaccines, whereas the majority of anti-vaxxers would not even click on it.\nTo test my assumption, I used sentiment analysis, \u0026ldquo;the process of analyzing large volumes of text to determine whether it expresses a positive sentiment, a negative sentiment, or a neutral sentiment\u0026rdquo; [IBM].

on average, had 15% positive sentiment comments. The news video had more comments with negative sentiments compared to the explainer. The manual reading of the comments told a slightly different story. Contrary to my assumption, there were a significant number of anti-vaxxers in the comment section of the explainer video. Note that being in the comment section may or may not mean that they have actually watched the video. There was also hate between the two polarized communities seen in these comments.\nAs I read the comments, I also realized that sentiment analysis might not have been the best method for determining whether the commenter was an anti-vaxxer or not. First, there are junk comments that need to be removed. Second, an anti-vaxxer could say, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m glad I did not take the vaccine,\u0026rdquo; which would be labeled as positive, whereas a comment by a pro-vaccine user, such as \u0026ldquo;the vaccine does not cause autism,\u0026rdquo; gets labeled as negative. Therefore, there is a need to fine-tune transformer models in order for them to label the comments as positive, negative, or neutral in the context of vaccines and the content of the video. Or at the very least, the interpretations of the sentiments should be done in the context of the video.\nFrom my limited review of the literature, I identified that YouTube comments have not been formally studied to understand how misinformation spreads. This only reinforces what Prof. Debayan mentioned in class about YouTube comments being an underexplored avenue in research.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-03-ngia-essay-04/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"anti-vaxxers----where-are-they\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnti-Vaxxers \u0026ndash; Where Are They?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecades of research show that vaccines save lives. However, there are communities of people known as anti-vaxxers who hesitate or refuse to get vaccinated. When faced with devastating pandemics like COVID-19, this \u0026ldquo;vaccine hesitancy\u0026rdquo; poses a threat to humanity. The advent of social media has only complicated the issue, providing opportunities for anti-vaxxers to spread misinformation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of the Extension Notes, I looked at YouTube comments on:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Term 03 | The New Geography of Information Age | Extension Notes 04: Anti-vaxxers---Where Are They"},{"content":"Having given a few tech demos, Prof. Debayan’s mention of Douglas Engelbart\u0026rsquo;s “Mother of All Demos (1968)” made me curious to watch it. The presentation was given at a conference in conjunction with a conference paper titled “A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect.”\nEngelbart showcased the oNLine System\u0026rsquo;s (NLS) features, such as file systems, text editors, and so on. He mentioned that his team used the consoles for “daily work,” perhaps making these the first-ever personal computers. It was interesting to see the seeds of what has now shaped current computers and the web, including hyperlinks, low-level and high-level languages, version control (bug and change trackers), compilers, file management, information retrieval, video conferencing, and so on.\nI had kept my expectations low, given that it was an old demo, but the video showcased the ingenuity of Engelbart and his colleagues. They demoed live at this conference in San Francisco and accomplished connecting to the console seamlessly with the Augmentation Research Centre, some miles away at Stanford.\nAmong the functionalities demonstrated, I particularly liked the following:\nText file rendering: I was struck by the clever data structuring and interactivity of the renders. The textual “statements” were also indexed, searchable, and hyperlinked. This is in stark contrast with the PDFs of 2024, which are unstructured and barely interactive. File system hierarchy. The key set, meant specifically for commands. Filtering using what we would now call primitive regular expressions: For example, there was a duty roster with role lists for all members. Using the compiler, one could filter for all members who knew, let us say, hardware. AI-Generated Summary of the Mother of All Demos Bridging the first demo of a personal computer with present-day technologies of Generative AI, I used Notebook LM to summarize the features demonstrated in the video. It made me realize the warp-speed advancement of technology. In 1968, a scientist showcased a bulky console, and within five decades, these portable computers have become not only ubiquitous but also possess capabilities unimaginable to the Augmentation Research Centre scientists, who were at the origin of its development.\nKey Features (As Summarized by Notebook LM) Hierarchical Structuring: Enables the organization of information in a hierarchical manner, facilitating efficient navigation, overview, and manipulation of complex data. View Control: Allows dynamic adjustment of how information is displayed, enabling users to focus on specific details or gain an overview, adapting to different needs. Hyperlinking (Jumping on Links): Facilitates navigation between different parts of a file or across multiple files, creating an interconnected network of information. Cross-Referencing: Supports linking between different parts of a document or different documents, enabling users to establish relationships and quickly access related information. Content Analysis: Offers a specialized language for creating search expressions, enabling sophisticated information retrieval based on content and patterns. Collaboration Tools: Includes features for real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to view, edit, and communicate on the same document. Specialized Languages: Utilizes a set of custom-designed languages, including control metalanguage, machine-oriented language (MOL), and content analysis language, to define system behavior, program functions, and facilitate precise communication. Unexplored Ideas Although most of the technologies were eventually picked up by corporations making computers, the sophisticated ideas – such as how to interact with and organize knowledge, and how groups of people can work with computers to increase collective IQs – were never explored to their full potential. Given the advent of technology, perhaps it is time to revisit the “Mother of All Demos” and think about, as Engelbart says, “getting better at getting better.”\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-03-ngia-essay-03/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHaving given a few tech demos, Prof. Debayan’s mention of Douglas Engelbart\u0026rsquo;s “Mother of All Demos (1968)” made me curious to watch it.

Previously, as part of a research project, I had spent a considerable amount of time understanding the current scientific publishing ecosystem, only to realize that it lacks transparency and is gatekept by a few companies. Further, the competitive nature of scientific publishing has caused nuanced problems, such as p-hacking, data fudging, and the reproducibility crisis. Since publishing is vital to the scientific process, I wondered if blockchain technology could solve some of these problems.\nThrough a quick literature search, I came across a paper titled “Blockchain, Wikis, and the Ideal Science Machine: With an Example from Genomics.” The author, David Koepsell, puts forth a novel approach that combines blockchain technology with wiki platforms to develop a “‘science machine’ that folds all processes together, from instrument to publication, enabling science to proceed as never before with greater transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.”\nTaking a typical genomics study as an example, the paper proposes a framework in which a unique hashed ID is given to the study’s subject, tissue sample, and deidentified genetic sequencing data, which can be accessed through a private key. The final product—the Wiki-style hypertext publication, which encapsulates the trail of the scientific process from hypothesis and data collection to analysis—is also placed on the blockchain system for the research community to access. Placing publications in ledgers allows the data to be decentralized, preventing the loss of information and monopoly by Western publishing companies and researchers.\nPerfect Science Machine\nHowever, adapting the blockchain system requires overhauling the current incentive system in academia, since universities rely on the reputation of journals to determine the reputation of scientists before hiring them. Therefore, along with proposing a decentralized system for scientific publishing, there is a need to develop a new system for evaluating the impact of contributions made by scientists.\nDemocratic Autonomous Organization (Mackey et al.) is one such attempt to retain the essence of the journal-based publishing system (ensuring that players such as reviewers, authors, etc. are retained) while leveraging blockchain technology to improve efficiency and transparency. I do not fully understand the framework, so I have referenced the papers in case anyone would like to deep dive.\nShared Blockchain Publishing Ecosystem\nHumanity relies on scientific processes to produce an ever-evolving knowledge graph, and there is a need to preserve the knowledge faithfully, decentralize it, while also accelerating the process itself. Blockchain, to me, offers hope.\nWorks Cited Koepsell, David. “Blockchain, Wikis, and the Ideal Science Machine: With an Example from Genomics.” Frontiers in Blockchain, vol. 2, Dec. 2019, https://doi.org/10.3389/fbloc.2019.00025.

I knew enough to ensure I checked the “Reject All” option whenever I visited a website, but I did not know the implications of not doing so. As Prof. Debayan explained how ad companies such as DoubleClick track me across websites to gather insights about my preferences and thereby show relevant advertisements, I became aware of my ignorance. I also realized that targeted advertising involves analyzing huge amounts of data and became curious to learn more about it.\nTo get started, I read a book called Big Data: A Very Short Introduction by Dawn E. Holmes. The initial chapters of the book cover how big data is stored and analyzed and lead up to the chapter titled “Big Data, Big Business.” Google, Amazon, and Netflix are used as case studies to discuss the Pay-Per-Click model, targeted advertising, and recommender systems (collaborative filtering and cosine similarity). The introductory chapters on storing unstructured data using the Hadoop Distributed File System and analysis methods such as MapReduce, PageRank, and Bloom Filters made me appreciate the complex and innovative algorithms built on top of these. If interested, I would recommend the book to learn more about these concepts, as I won’t be able to explain them in detail in these Extension Notes.\nIn particular, I was fascinated by the logic behind collaborative filtering, whereby an e-commerce product is recommended based on the purchases of other users whose profiles are similar to mine. This is done by using Jaccard’s index, which is defined as the number of items two sets (customers) have in common, divided by the total number of distinct items.\nLet’s say I am interested in cookbooks and have bought Daily Salads and Desserts Tomorrow from Amazon (Table 1). The collaborative filtering algorithm calculates Jaccard’s index for all the other cookbook buyers by comparing our purchases to recommend what to buy next.\nDaily Salads Pasta Today Desserts Tomorrow Wine For All Me bought bought Jones bought bought Brown bought bought Table 1: Books Bought by Me, Jones, and Brown (from Big Data: A Very Short Introduction)\nComparison Number of Titles in Common Total Number of Distinct Titles Purchased Jaccard Index Me and Jones 1 3 1/3 Me and Brown 1 4 1/4 Jones and Brown 1 4 1/4 Table 2: Jaccard’s Index (from Big Data: A Very Short Introduction)\nWe see that the Jaccard’s index is highest between Me and Jones. The book Jones purchased, which I have not, is Wine For All, and that is what Amazon recommends (Table 2). Cosine similarity is similar to collaborative filtering; however, it also takes into account the ratings given by customers for the products.\nAfter reading about all the different algorithms in the Big Data book, I paused to consider the implications of algorithms. Combined with my reading about the “Warehouse Wage Slave” experience (McClelland), it made me think that we are all at the mercy of a handful of giant companies. We are succumbing to algorithms like recommender systems, prompting these companies to develop even more complex algorithms to further exploit the ever-increasing big data we continue to contribute. We buy more and more products, leading to more and more warehouse workers robotically scanning and packing the products, like cookbooks the algorithm recommended. It is a vicious cycle. Will we even have control over our desires in the future? Or will they be algorithm-driven? Are we becoming robots? I cannot help but worry about the societal implications of these technologies.\nThis quick research has made me more mindful of the trail I leave on the web. Maybe it is time to move away from big companies like Google and Amazon and do more than just “Reject All.”\nWorks Cited\nHolmes, Dawn E. Big Data: A Very Short Introduction.

I am excited for the courses this time. We have Microeconomics and The New Geography in the Information Age (NGIA) \u0026ndash; a funky name but it is a course on information in the age of internet. This week features me singing, reading a lot, working on Chevening Application, spending time with the cohort and having quality time with Karthik.\n2024-10-28 First day of Term 03. We had to back-to-back lectures. Woke up early, made it to class 20 minutes before it started. Prof. A. K. Shivkumar from Harvard is teaching us Microeconomics. I like his lecture-approach, simple whiteobard and marker style. We were acquainted with the basics of microeconomics. The problems of the society \u0026ndash; what to produce, how to produce them, how much. We discussed the need for intervention of the market \u0026ndash; supply-side and demand-side. We ended with with model of economy. In the last half an hour of the class, we looked at the case study: India in numbers.\nModel of Economy\nNGIA was interesting, too. We discussed China\u0026rsquo;s social credit system and surveillance. The course is taught by Prof. Debayan Gupta. It is a bit hard to keep up with him as he throws out ideas and readings. But I can see the course being fun.\nI had Office Hours with Centre for Writing and Communication (CWC) to discuss my application on which I had made decent progress, before going to the concert by Amit Chaudari hosted for the YIF cohort. Later in the day, I myself perfomed at the Broadway-themed open mic. Singing Let It Go from Frozen reminded of countless times my sister and I have sung this song together. It was special to sing this song to an energetic audience.\nI came back, worked on the application and slept late after fixing the argument with Karthik.\n2024-10-29 Another fun Economics lecture. We discussed the Demand Curve.\nIn the afternoon, our ELM team was supposed to have an interview with the India Science Festival folks but they did not turn up to the meeting. I had the Critical Writing class next. We disussed \u0026ldquo;Critical\u0026rdquo; theories and I lost my lecturer half way through.\nI spent the rest of the day on my application.\n2024-10-30 My nose was blocked, which kept me up for the better half of the night. Woke up late. Missed the first ten minutes of NGIA lecture. But the class discussion was great. Our case study was Amazon. We looked their business model, Bezos\u0026rsquo;s vision when he first started the company, and so on. We moved on to talking about ads, user profiling, cookies and so on.\nI had yet another Office Hours with CWC. It has been very useful to think out loud before drafting the essays.\nThe rest of the day was spent lazing around watching Kara and Nate, writing the essays in bits and pieces, and talking to Karthik.\nReading my essays\n2024-10-31 \u0026ndash; Start of Deepavali Break The campus felt very empty. In fact, there were only three people on my floor who stayed back on campus for Deepavali. I started my day with the \u0026ldquo;Study in the UK\u0026rdquo; essay. It took quite some time to research about the shortlisted courses and write something concise. I took the afternoon off to join the reading session hosted by the leftover cohort on campus. I read a chapter of the book, \u0026ldquo;Understanding Comics\u0026rdquo;, but spent the majority of the time socialising and listening to stories from people. It was relaxing.\nI came back to room, worked on my essays, watched an episode of Phineas and Ferb with Karthik (we had been meaning to watch it for a year now) and called it a day. I could not sleep for some reason. My body felt itchy and breathing became harder. I probably must have fallen asleep at around 0100.\n2024-11-01 I woke up late as a consequence of the disastrous night. I suspected bed bugs and washed all my clothes and bedding. I read FAST India\u0026rsquo;s SciComm ThinkLab report and STIP. I got introduced to The Very Short Introduction Series by Oxford by one of my peers and spent the afternoon reading the tiny book on Environmental Politics.\nIn the evening, we all got together to celebrate Deepavali. I am so glad one of us took the initiative to do something to mark the day. Although not grand, this was the first time in six years that I was celebrating Deepavali. Still away from home. Maybe next year.\nI finished drafting all the essays and felt very pleased with myself.\n2024-10-02 A regular morning. I read my essays again, made minor changes and finalised the version. In the afternoon, I contacted people asking for feedback. I worked on Critical Writing research project summarising one of the interviews.\nAbi arrived in the evening, welcomed her to room. The evening was spent on the new Very Short Introduction I borrowed from the library: Big Data. Post dinner, I conversed with a Chevening Scholar who gave feedback on my essays. I was happy that she thought most of my essays were great. Boosts confidence. She had several suggestions, I will working on them over the next two days.\n2024-10-03 Brings us to today. Spent the morning reading the tiny book on Big Data. Read about the plight of Warehouse workers (a recommended reading for NGIA) and am now at the library.

We had to back-to-back lectures. Woke up early, made it to class 20 minutes before it started. Prof. A. K. Shivkumar from Harvard is teaching us Microeconomics. I like his lecture-approach, simple whiteobard and marker style. We were acquainted with the basics of microeconomics. The problems of the society \u0026ndash; what to produce, how to produce them, how much. We discussed the need for intervention of the market \u0026ndash; supply-side and demand-side. We ended with with model of economy. In the last half an hour of the class, we looked at the case study: India in numbers.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Week 14| The Young India Fellowship"},{"content":"2024-10-21 Woke up early today.

Sometimes you feel great looking at your past work summarised, and at other times you feel stuck, doubting yourself.\n2024-10-22 Typical work day. Our ELM team worked remotely? Oh, yes. we did. We discussed the mechanics of the world in detail. One of our team members was leaving home. I spoke to Karan during our meeting and he told me I will not be able to attend SJAI\u0026rsquo;s Science Journalism Conference in full.\nLater in the evening, I went to the lamp making event hosted by the Makerspace. I had a fun time cutting wire, stripping, soldering and connecting the plug. We couldn\u0026rsquo;t get to making the lamp cover though :(.\nThe wire socket I made. The bulb in the box.\n2024-10-23 It finally felt like we made progress. We had a Naamkaran ceronomy for the factions in the game and charted out the game scenarios arc. More details on the Notes page: https://pralay.netlify.app/notes/2024-10-23/.\n2024-10-24 After every productive day, it feels like we need time off. We took the day to come up with game scenarios. I continued working on my Chevening application. I had super helpful Office Hours with Soumya from Centre for Writing and Communication on the application.\nI also got myself two charms :)\nSnitch and black cat\n2024-10-25 We discussed our scenarios. I finally felt like all the basework we had done to build the world was all coming together through scenarios. Check out the scenarios here: https://pralay.netlify.app/notes/2024-10-25/.\nWe were suppposed to go to a student concert, but could not get tickets. Arushi and I ended up watching Matilda together. It\u0026rsquo;s a fun light-hearted movie :)\n2024-10-26 The day started with Office Hours for the Climate Game. We then brainstormed the board game version of it for the upcoming interview with the India Science Festival.\nPost lunch, Arushi and I left for Delhi. It took a lot of internal convincing for me to say yes to going out. We visited the Hello Kitty exhibit and roamed around Connaught Place. I got myself a jacket and I love it! Hanging out with Arushi was fun. I finally know how it feels like to go out with your best friend :)\nCute Hello Kity Dining Set under the staircase\nMe peeping to see the Dining Set\nMe writing a letter\nWe were exhausted by the time we came back. I showered, ate dinner and slept after arguing with Karthik.\n2024-10-27 I woke up late. Got out of my room to attend this super cool sound engineering workshop. I washed my hair and tried working on the Chevening application. I got sidetracked by the STEM Quiz. Our team did miserably. I worked on the application and called it a day.\nI felt a major FOMO missing out on Anoop\u0026rsquo;s (my cousin) wedding.

As a result, I was stressed, confused, tired, agititated (fought with Karthik quite a lot). I feel like or even have the time to journal as you can tell. But we have made it through. Here\u0026rsquo;s my attempt at recounting key events from the two weeks.\nAt glance, here was my deadline list. Art Appreciation and Shakespeare combined, I had 5 assignments, a conference presentation (The Tech We Want), meeting with Prof. Vijayraghavan, a scholarship application (I discontinued working on it).\nMy deadline list\nAll of what I did Week 11 2024-10-07 On Monday, we watched Ram-Leela, an adaptation of Romeo-Juliet. For a movie with shooting, Bolywood drama, and so on, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t excepting to be in tears when Ram and Leela die. I gained more depth through the discussion in class, including the politics surrounding the movie and its name, the reason for extravagant set, the references to Romeo-Juliet, and so on. (Wish I had the time to summarise here).\n2024-10-08 We watched another adaptation of Romeo-Juliet, Arshinagar. It was a low-budget movie, with some very funny fight scences. I did not like it. After having a professor who knew everything about comics, I spent the rest of the evening working on the Art Appreciation group assignment. I was a bit disappointed by the team not synergising. All used Generative AI models for creating their content, I felt very lonely in the pursuit of actually trying to understand comics.\n2024-10-09 The Presentation Day Although not sufficient, I had curated enough material about comics to feel confident. It was important I felt prepared; it was first ever presentation to the cohort. The presentation went okay. The professor enjoyed. I sat through couple of presentations; they were interesting. Many were performed-based \u0026ndash; entropy through music, roleplay, and so on.\nLater, we had the Art Exhibition, so many amazing paintings. Our cohort is so talented.\n2024-10-10 We discussed Arshinagar, the movie, in our final Shakespeare class. I spent all my free time working on the Commonwealth Application. I eventually realised I did not have genuine answers to some of the questions. I felt incomptent to even describe why lack science communication is relevant in the present times. I gave up on applying. It was a tough decision, but in retrospect the right decision, because I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have had the time.\n2024-10-11 I spoke to Vijayraghavan. It was not glorious as I thought it would be. Here was the reflection I wrote:\nProf. Vijayraghavan and I set up the agenda for the mentorship sessions: figuring out what my next steps would be to continue working on science communication and open science. Prof. advised me to list science communicators, track their career trajectories, and analyse whether I can emulate their career steps. Similarly, he also suggested researching communication organisations (in general), ThinkTanks, and international grants, that might be interested in science communication. His idea is that I can join the communications team and pursue science communication.\nFor continuing work on open science, Prof. asked me what I wanted to do. Are there organisations I can work for? I discussed that organisations like Wikimedia Foundation, Mozilla, etc. have openings. But they require the employee to also take up managerial or technical work. Prof. suggested I showcase those skills to get the job. I have to be a science communicator and a manager.\nHe said that higher education is an option only if you are rich enough to study abroad. Yes, the degree holds an intrinsic value but its objective is also to extort money.\nAll in all, the call was a reality check. Prof. said that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be chasing exciting ideas and interests. The world will not support me or my interests. I will have to find a way to get someone to sign a cheque. Therefore, I should be thinking about how to fit into organisations, and have a longer-term vision rather than just pursuing interests.\nOver the week, in the Critical Writing classes, we studied Ethnographical practices. We are also assigned a group research project. Our group is studying how YIFs take decisions about spending their time.\n2024-10-12 to 2024-10-14 I spent these three days completely on the final Shakespeare assignment. Our team chose to reimagine Romeo and Juliet for art and science. We personified beaker and brush and through their conversations unravelled the interconnections between arts and sciences. In the short time we had, Arushi made drawings for every scene and we produced a stop-motion animation. For reasons, there was no synergy in the group and the experience wasn not enjoyable.\nOn 14th, I had office hour with a Creative Writiing faculty. She gave useful feedback on my previous scholarship application. There is so much to improve upon for me. I\u0026rsquo;m so glad I chose not to submit the Commonwealth Application, it would have been sub-par.\nOh, and one of the days, I got to know I was selected to attend SJAI conference :)\nWeek 12 2024-10-15 Shakespeare Festival I was blown away by the amazing reimaginations the cohort had produced. From musical, Qawali, poetry, comedy, to queer love, cross-religion marriage, and so much more! However, I did not feel fulfilled with our reimagination. The idea did not materialise the way I would have wanted it to.\nI had no time to relax. I came back and work on the The Tech We Want Summit slides and Art Appreciation final paper.\n2024-10-16 For the paper, not surprisingly, I chose to write about the power of scientific illustrations. I wrote case studies of Jane Richardson\u0026rsquo;s Ribbon Diagrams, David Goodsell\u0026rsquo;s cell landscapes, and Nirupa Rao\u0026rsquo;s tree illustrations. It was fun.\n2024-10-17 From waking up, I worked on making the slides for my presentation at The Tech We Want Summit. I was on the sustainability panel and had to be creative in talking about #semanticClimate from that lens. Peter explained how unsustainable PDFs are as they locks up the knowledge. #semanticClimate, by turning the document semantic, is helping reducing the opportunity cost aned making the knowledge usable. In particular, Peter re-discovered the concept of 5-starification of data and suggested we call our software chain as engine 5-starifying documents. I put together the slides in couple of hours and presented at the conference later that day.\nThe presentation went well. The Summit was well-curated and I listened to all the panels \u0026ndash; the poltiics of open tools, maintainence, and so on.\n2024-10-18 Started with office hours with our ELM supervisor, then spent the morning on our ELM. Later. I went to a higher studies career fair in the afternoon. They weren\u0026rsquo;t useful, but I was mainly there to collect brouchers I\u0026rsquo;ll never read.\nI attended Demo sessions of The Tech We Want, the tools were all super cool.\n2024-10-19 Anniv day Spent the morning and afternoon on the ELM. Later in the evening, we went around sticking posters to get people\u0026rsquo;s attention to fill our climate survey.\nKarthik and I watched \u0026ldquo;Inside Out 2\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;m super glad we spent quality time together. Arushi had gone out and got me a Palmier to eat. The movie wrecked me, but I felt so much at peace after spending time relaxing with Karthik.\nLater in the evening, I spoke to Adrian. I gave him updates about what had happened in the past two weeks (not too different from what I\u0026rsquo;ve written here), we discussed comics, nobel prize, views on AI, and much more. Slept late.\n2024-10-20 Worked till afternoon. Felt like our ELM team had hit a slump. Finally got to journalling. Spoke to Chandrani in the evening. In giving her a gist of the past 3 months, I realised the breadth and depth of work I\u0026rsquo;ve done so far at the YIF. After cutting the call, I went to meet Arushi and Shamant to discuss music. Post dinner, I met Pravin who told me everything about PowerBi and the big data work he does in the social sector related to schooling. He really has inspired me to work on meaninful data problems.\nReading List [Book] Understanding Comics, Scott McCloud [Book] Sequentual Art, Will Einser ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/week-11-and-12/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDays: 2024-10-07 to 2024-10-20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal two weeks of Term 02, Week 11 and 12, were filled with deadlines.

Learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else.” - Leonardo Da Vinci\nAs a non-artist in biology classes, I was always in awe of botany and zoology professors who drew detailed diagrams of, let’s say, a dissected flower part or insect organ on the chalkboard. The professors captured all the details a photograph would, except that the diagram was better at spotlighting the key characteristics of the specimen. To draw such a detailed diagram, one observes patiently and records — skills valuable to any researcher. Therefore, as biology students, we were encouraged to draw, even if we didn’t come with the skillset of an artist.\nOne might find scientific illustrations — especially of plants, trees, animals, and insects — obsolete in the digital age. However, that’s far from true. In this essay, using case studies, I will outline in-depth how scientific illustrations are an invaluable tool in the scientific process in the 21st century.\nIllustrations Visualize the Unseeable Beyond botanical or anatomical diagrams, illustration skills are useful in visualizing abstract concepts. Cellular and molecular biology involves studying structures smaller than the wavelength of light. Drawing models of microscopic structures, such as cells and molecules, helps a researcher understand biological processes, and generate and communicate ideas (Iwasa). Described below are three such innovations:\n1.1. Ribbon Structures of Protein In 1960, Max Perutz and John Kendrew deciphered the structure of a protein for the first time using X-ray crystallography. That protein was hemoglobin, which is responsible for oxygen transportation in humans. Once the technique was established, more protein structures were discovered. Representing these protein structures became a problem. Although proteins are small molecules, they are made up of several thousand individual atoms, making it hard for scientists to make molecular models. In the early days of structural biology, there was a need to devise a method to visualize these structures in order to communicate the findings to the scientific community.\nRichardson’s ribbon structures became a consistent system for drawing proteins. Quoting Richardson herself: “Ribbon drawings are an excellent tool for first comprehending the overall organization of a protein structure, on which cones can later hang the important details.” These ribbon structures are ubiquitously used in scientific papers and high school textbooks.\nTo solve the visualization problem, Jane Richardson, a biochemist, developed the innovative ribbon diagrams. Recapping high school biology, proteins consist of a chain of amino acids that naturally fold to form a 3-D structure. Linus Pauling showed that there are two basic shapes protein parts take up: alpha helices and beta strands. In Richardson’s sketches, “alpha helices are coils that look like the tails of decorative ribbons, curled with the edge of a pair of scissors. Beta strands are arrows that point in the direction in which the amino acid chain was built.” (Saplakoglu)\nRichardson’s ribbon structures became a consistent system for drawing proteins. Quoting Richardson herself: “Ribbon drawings are an excellent tool for first comprehending the overall organization of a protein structure, on which cones can later hang the important details.” These ribbon structures are ubiquitously used in scientific papers and high school textbooks.\n1.2. Cellular Landscapes Zooming out from proteins, we move onto cells. Until the 1960s, the cell icon resembled an omelette, with the blob of the nucleus surrounded by cytoplasm. In 1961, with advancements in technology, the icon was replaced by the cell’s illustration showcasing the subcellular structures.\nAn innovative representation of cells came in the 1990s. David Goodsell, a structural biologist studying biological molecules, started making illustrations of cells showcasing the complexity of cells at the molecular level. Goodsell uses scientific data from crystallography and microscopy to draw the structures of macromolecules, such as proteins. He combines the structural data of individual molecules with information on their interaction with other molecules and their position, size, and so on, to develop a cellular landscape. The result is an illustration that artistically depicts the complexity of a cell and accurately represents biological processes. He has a distinctive style for his paintings. He uses watercolors and simple pastel colors for molecules.\n1.3. Illustrations Frame the Unframable and Focus Beyond Photographs Conventional Botanical Illustrations The history of botanical illustrations goes back to the 15th century, all the way back to Leonardo Da Vinci and perhaps earlier. However, botanical illustrations are still relevant today. Since an artist can observe specimens from various angles and magnifications, they can develop a single drawing that highlights the key features of the species.\nTrees Imagine being a wildlife conservationist interested in visually documenting trees of rainforests. How would one fathom clicking a picture such that a 110-foot beast like Vernonia arborea (seen in the Western Ghats) is captured in a single frame? Two conversationalists, Divya Mudappa and T.R. Shankar Raman of the Nature Conservation Foundation, ran into this problem and decided to collaborate with Nirupa Rao, a botanical illustrator. Through the collaborative project, they documented 30 regional trees.\nIn her TED video, Rao admits that drawing trees is difficult. To draw a single tree, she had to observe the buttress by standing in front of it and climbing the cliff to observe the canopy. She also had to consistently observe the changes for months to draw all the organs (flower, fruit, and so on). By combining data points gathered spatially and temporally, she came up with a single illustration that had all the details of the tree — something a photograph or series of photographs could never achieve.\nRao has also documented rare species and biological events such as the blooming of Neelakurinji.\nConclusion These case studies show that the scientific process relies heavily on the innovations of illustrations. From proteins to trees, science has progressed because of researcher-artists\u0026rsquo; contributions to enabling communication and the common language of visuals in the scientific community.\nWork Cited An Illustrated Kingdom of Real, Fantastical Plants | Nirupa Rao.

Is it worth adding another stress to the existing masala of stresses? I don\u0026rsquo;t even know what to do differently from my previous applications. Maybe I should talk to more people and ask help.\nI slept late again. This time I was speaking to Karthik and got carried away.\n2024-10-01 Morning off after a long time. I spent the morning on the Art Appreciation group project abstract and later figuring out deadlines.\nBack to back classes in the evening. I had fun learning about ethnography. We did a quick observation activity. I went to the library with my team and made notes about the environment and people. Shakespeare class was a little dissapointing. All we spoke about was death and desire and I got bored. My roommate and I had a karaoke night later. A nice distraction. Wish I sang more often.\n2024-10-02 Finally got the time to write updates on this blog and think about what to make for my final presentation. I had a tough conversation with Karthik; brain is a bit messed up.\nThe log is being written on 2024-10-20 i.e., 18 days later\nLater that day, I attended an origami workshop and had my first jam session at Ashoka. We sang Hindustani and Carnatic. I had fun.\nLater that week We read Layla and Majnun and followed it up with a classroom discussion. I remember feeling empathetic towards Majnun, the mad man. It was a really good introduction to Sufi literature.\nAs a part of YIF Mentorship Programme, I wrote an Expression of Interest to have Prof. Vijayraghavan as my mentor. He agreed.

We played a game called Civilisation for inspiration.\nSaturday, I submitted the application to Science Journalism Association of India\u0026rsquo;s conference happening in Dec. 2024.\nOn Sunday, I had made my final canvas for my Art Appreciation course. I adapted an Islamic geometric pattern. It was therapeutic to draw circles and lines, and paint the shapes.

We looked at different art movements \u0026ndash; renaissance to performance art. I performed My Heart Will Go On in the farewell class. I got nervous, yet again. Being around talented people all the time can do that for you.\nI spent the first half of the week writing the Expression of Interest to have Prof. Vijayraghavan as my mentor at the YIF. I have been an advocate for open science since I learnt about it. But in writing to Prof. Vijayraghavan, I collated by scattered thoughts about open science in India to coherent narrative. I collasced my interests in science communication and open science. Prathima Muniyappa, an alum of the YIF, had told me about thinking in first principles. I finally noticed commonality two separate career trajectories of mine.\nMe figuring out the commonality between Open Science and Science Communication\nLater in the week, we had an Alum-in-Residence session. Worrin Muivah, the Alum this time, was such a fun person! He runs something called the STEP Academy in North East India. He said what he took away from the YIF was importance of building genuine relationships with people.\nWhat else happened? AC broke down. I slept at around 0200 one day. That was fun, haha. I attended Startup Ashoka to get a feel for the start-up culture and also talk to people about our ELM. Needless to say, I didn\u0026rsquo;t like it that much. I\u0026rsquo;m just averse to words like venture capital, business model, etc. But I got a nice hoodie, so I\u0026rsquo;m not complaining.\nDuring the weekend, I took interviews as a part of ELM. I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt so much more about games and sustainability initatives that exists already. Talking to as many people early on in the project helps in addressing some obvious but overlooked loopholes in the solution in the initial phase. However, it also confuses you because of conflicting opinions you hear.\nAND, most importantly, I went out to Delhi for the first time. I was supposed to go out with Arushi, but Arjun said he had time. This something I wrote on the Metro:\nBaby\u0026rsquo;s Day Out, Delhi Edition.\nFor the first time in two months, I managed to get out of Ashoka. Every time I tried to make plans, I had to abandon them because of deadlines or health. Finally, the stars aligned today.\nI met a friend of mine, Arjun, for the first time at Hauz Khas. I had my YIF friends to guide me to the metro station, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t hard. I got a bit nervous when I had to wait almost an hour at Hauz Khas metro for my friend to turn up. We went to Naivedyam for lunch. Decent Uttampam and great Chutney. Post lunch, We roamed around Hauz Khas village. We checked out a vintage poster shop, Chumbak, Minisou, and an art gallery. Awkwardness lingered for a while, but we got along well. We learnt more about each other. Spoke a bit about YIF and his work.\nThe experience of going out (minus the meeting part) was disorienting. Everything around me \u0026ndash; the stores, the roads, the people, the train, the station \u0026ndash; seemed familiar. Yet I felt paralysed. I felt like I did not know how to interact with my surroundings. Adding to the feeling was that I was not hearing South Indian languages anymore. Made me feel even more out of place, scared almost. It was like I was re-learning how to be human.\nRandom street in Haus Khas Village\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/week-09/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSince I\u0026rsquo;m writing the account a week later, it\u0026rsquo;ll be brief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had the last set of Art Appreciation classes.

I felt bit out of place amidst the undergrads in the beginning, but I settled in as we went on. We worked with Pico W. We were introduced to various pins on the board and what they do.

Naturally, I bumped into more non-kannada-speaking folks than usual, and English became my go-to language. Nothing to fret about. All my life I’ve enjoyed speaking in English. I took pride in being fluent in the language at school and even college. I often said I think in English. I had no issues giving presentations, making points in meetings, or having casual conversations at the workplace.\nBut after a while, I noticed something. When it came to emotions or describing an incident that moved me, English failed. I found myself reaching out to a specific Kannada word, only to not find an English equivalent. I missed speaking in Kannada. Maybe my brain was not thinking in English after all? It seemed like certain Kannada words and emotions were closely tied and imprinted, which English words could never replace.\nInterestingly, I knew only two languages until I went to college (Kannada and English). From friends and roommates, I picked up Tamil. And, somehow, because it was friends from whom I learnt Tamil, the language always offers comfort, warmth and fun whenever I speak it.\nTwo Young India Fellows also offered perspectives, which supplemented my experiences. Unlike my urge to switch to Kannada in certain personal settings, Arushi, who is from Jodhpur, said she has no difficulty expressing herself in Hindi (home language) or English. On the other hand, Sohan, a Bengali who has lived in Gurgaon all his life, shared a feeling similar to my own for Tamil. He remarked, “Hindi is a “Mazedhar” language; a language he loves speaking with friends”.\nIn conclusion, emotions around language seem to be guided by various factors. First, the social and cultural environment in which it was learnt from and spoken. Tamil (for me) and Hindi (for Sohan) are fun because we talk to friends in them. Second, the richness of our vocabulary and tight connection between specific words and emotions. I take pride in my English in an academic context, but when explaining emotions I prefer more precise words in Kannada.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-01-cw-on-emotions-and-languages-assignment/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAfter living in Mysore (a quiet city in Karnataka) for most of my life, I moved to Bengaluru last year for work.

We have two interesting courses, Art Appreciation (by Prof. Anunaya Chaubey) and Shakespeare and the World (Prof. Jonathan Gil Harris and Prof. Madhavi Menon).\nDaily Breakdown 2024-09-09 I had an uncomfortable experience during the first Art Appreciation class. Prof. asked to paint a canvas in an hour, give it a title, make note of challenges and display. I made an embarassingly bad painting. I was almost in tears after looking around and seeing amazing art works. I felt even worse because of how I reacted. I wish I was slightly better at dealing with being sucky at something.\nIf you are interested to check out my paitning\nOn the other hand, the Shakespeare lecture was fun. It felt like I was watching a Netflix comedy show. The Prof. is very engaging and theatrical. We spent the first hour discussing the relevance of the course by debunking myth that Shakespeare is English and elite. One common obstacle we face with Shakespeare is his language. We looked at why that\u0026rsquo;s the case, and how one can overcome it.\nLecture notes #01\nAnd, later in the evening, we had an open mic! I finally, after waiting for more than a year, got to perform :) I did a cover version of Love Me Like You Do, by Ellie Goulding. I was very nervous in the beginning, but I felt it leaving me towards the end of my first performance (thanks to the amazing YIF crowd). I had this familiar urge of wanting to perform again. Luckily, a batchmate of mine, had got a guitar and we ended up performing impromptu. A fun night performing and watching other people perfrom as well :)\nFirst peformance at the YIF\n2024-09-10 I woke up tired and hungry. But no choice. Had to get ready because for the 0930 Art Appreciation lecture. In the lecture, we discussed what art is, how we make sense of visual world, and so on. We also explored topics like scopic regime, gestalt. Towards the end of the lecture, we looked at some art work to understand what beauty and aesthetics really mean. In the evening, we had a Discussion Session, where we made sense of each others\u0026rsquo; paintings. It was interesting how none of the people in my group thought it was a \u0026lsquo;bad\u0026rsquo; painting.\nSpent the rest of the day on the ISF proposal.\n2024-09-11 Again, woke up tired and hungry. No choice. Art Appreciation lecture. We looked at does one make sense of art. Based on discussions from past two days, we arrived at: \u0026ldquo;Artwork embodies an Intention, which is experienced by Beholder, who uses sensations, knowledge and emotion to generate an artistic experience.\u0026ldquo;We looked at some case studies: Wind of Sea, Madhubani paintings and Yayomi Kasama\u0026rsquo;s work.\nShakespeare and the World lecture was super exciting. We discussed Ovid\u0026rsquo;s (Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;bro crush\u0026rdquo;) Metamorphoses. First, I was blown away by the insights the class had about the literary work. Professor complimented them to make the conversation complete. I enjoyed it. I\u0026rsquo;m now intrigued by the concept of Metamorphoses \u0026ndash; the chaos, the partition of inseparables by gods and humans, the order, the chaos which follows again, the cycle continues.\nClass Notes\n2024-09-12 Art Appreciation class as usual. We discussed Unifying Classical and Romantic, the reasoning and imagination. In the Critical Writing class, we explored the concept of literacy and distinguished it from literacy rate. We looked at literacy as something which is specific, plural and contextual. Finally, we had our first stage reading of Shakespeare\u0026rsquo;s drama. We finished 3 scenes from The Midsummer Night\u0026rsquo;s Dream.\n2024-09-13 First ELM day. Went well. We did some logistical work, brainstormed a bit, called it a day.\nI attended the session on how to approach Masters application. It was one of the most useful sessions on higher studies I\u0026rsquo;ve ever attended.\nI ended up going to a movie called \u0026ldquo;Us\u0026rdquo;. It was my first-ever horror movie. Scenes were disturbing. The movie has a really good political message though.\n2024-09-14 Couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep well. Woke up feeling tired. Feverish towards the afternoon.

But I also explored how to run them in Python. So, it only makes sense for my final report to be an interactive Python file.\n# Import packages from scipy.stats import norm import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import random import seaborn as sns Part A Choose three of the four following statistical tools (A.1 – A.4). For each of your chosen three, write a short response exhibiting your understanding of the tool (250 words maximum each).\nA.1 Normal Distribution The Bell Curve: The one curve that rules them all!\nBefore we arrive at what a normal distribution is, I\u0026rsquo;d like you to devise an experiment.\nThrow a dice 10 times and note the average. An example outcome would be: [6 5 2 1 5 4 4 5 4 1]. The average is 3.7. Will the averages always remain the same? Would there be a pattern in the averages noted?\nMaybe you\u0026rsquo;d say let\u0026rsquo;s repeat the same process 10000 times. Of course, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t sit and throw dice 100000, would you? You get a computer to do it.\nAs you shall see below, I\u0026rsquo;ve written a few lines of code to simulate a throw of dice. I\u0026rsquo;ve asked it to generate random numbers between 1 and 6 (mimicking throwing a die) 10 times, note the average and repeat 10000 times.\nLooking at 10000 data points would be tedious. Instead, let\u0026rsquo;s visualise. A histogram plot reveals that there most of the average is centred around a number (mean) and it is almost symmetrically spread out. How data is spread is given by standard deviation. This type of distribution is a normal distribution. It is also known as a bell curve, or as the professor likes to call it: \u0026ldquo;The one curve that rules them all!\u0026rdquo;\nrng = np.random.default_rng(seed=2310) rolls = rng.integers(low=1, high=6, endpoint=True, size=(10_000, 10)) sns.histplot(data=rolls.mean(axis=1), binwidth=0.1) plt.show() rolls_sort = np.sort(rolls.mean(axis=1)) rolls_mean = np.average(rolls_sort) rolls_std = np.std(rolls_sort) norm(rolls_mean, rolls_std).cdf(4) 0.8176661208472158 We find normal distributions everywhere. Height and weight distribution in a class, people\u0026rsquo;s shower time, etc. Knowing that their distribution is normal will help you make useful inferences such as z% of data lies between x and y range. For example, 81% of the averages are between 0 and 4.\nStandard Normal Deviation When the mean(μ) is 0 and the standard deviation(σ) is 1, then we call it a \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; normal distribution curve. The area under the curve is 1. The concept of standard deviation is important, we will come to it in the later section.\nrandom_numbers_0_1 = [random.normalvariate(0, 1) for _ in range(1_000_000)] sns.histplot(data=random_numbers_0_1, binwidth=0.1) plt.show() A.2 Sampling Choosing a subset or sample of individuals from a statistical population is called sampling. Why is it important? Well, let\u0026rsquo;s go back to our die example. We were lucky that we could simulate 10000*10 throws. But let\u0026rsquo;s say you are collecting data on a country\u0026rsquo;s opinion on who they think would win the election, or you are a researcher testing whether a drug works and can be deployed to the entire population. Realistically, you get only a subset of the statistical population.\nNow, would the sample be representative of the population? In other words, can you draw inferences from the sample that is true for the entire population?\nTo answer this, let\u0026rsquo;s go back to our dice throws. Out of the 10000 averages, let\u0026rsquo;s get 500 of them at random.\nrandom_500_throw_averages = np.random.choice(rolls.mean(axis=1), 500, replace=False) sorted_500 = np.sort(random_500_throw_averages) plt.plot(sorted_500, norm.pdf(sorted_500, loc=np.average(random_500_throw_averages), scale=np.std(random_500_throw_averages))) [\u0026lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7f440f945db0\u0026gt;] You notice that the random 500 when plotted gives us the familiar bell curve. So, this sample represents the whole population of dice throw averages. However, is this always true?\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll reduce the sample size to 20 and see what happens.\nrandom_20_throw_averages = np.random.choice(rolls.mean(axis=1), 20, replace=False) sorted_20 = np.sort(random_20_throw_averages) plt.plot(sorted_20, norm.pdf(sorted_20, loc=np.average(random_20_throw_averages), scale=np.std(random_20_throw_averages))) [\u0026lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7f440fbd8340\u0026gt;] With 20 throw averages, the characteristic normal curve is gone. One should therefore ensure that their sample size is big enough. There are other aspects to consider, too. Is there a bias in the sample? Maybe during the sample collection, we somehow happened to pick up more outliers giving them a greater representation. The process of sampling itself introduces errors, that need to be accounted for. Therefore, analysing samples to draw inferences should be done meticulously considering aspects such as sample size, bias, error, etc.\nA.4 Randomness As always, we\u0026rsquo;ll go back to our die experiment. Think about a single 10-die throw. The outcome of that set of throws is random. However, we saw that after repeating the throws many many times, it followed a normal distribution. If you know the probability distribution, you can predict the probability of a given random event happening.\nRandomness is an important feature of data sets. For example, we suspected, in Sir Cyril Burt\u0026rsquo;s case, a possible fraud when we inferred that his IQ data were too normal, i.e., not random as one would naturally see. There are many statistical tests one can run like Chi-Square Tests to determine the normalness of data.\nWhat is interesting to note is that in the previous questions so far, we have used a Python module called random, which simulated die throws by providing us with sequences of random numbers between 1 and 6. We also used the same module to pick 500 random die-throw averages to form our sample.\nPart B Write three short responses (150 words maximum each) on three topics of your choosing from the course.\nB.1 What would Polya do? What would Polya do? One of the major learnings from the course has been Polya\u0026rsquo;s approach to problem solving.\nWhile doing the statistics assignments, we routinely ensured we asked the following questions:\nWhat is asked? How to tackle the problem? Oftentimes, we resorted to asking simple yet crucial questions like how many Pronto Pizza deliveries were above the limit of 25 minutes? Solve the problem. This was the fun part. I enjoyed learning about Python packages to perform statistical analysis. Look back and look ahead. While writing reports, we questioned what the inferences meant. We looked back to ask, for example, which days of the week are the deliveries late? This helped us give specific recommendations to the company (looking ahead). Any statistician sitting to analyse data should answer these questions, first.\nB.2 How to calculate the area under the normal curve? In our averages of the die-throw experiment, I made a statement that 81% of the averages were between 0 and 4. How did I get that percentage? I used one of the important features of the normal distribution. The area under the curve gives the probability of a given event.\nHow to calculate the area under the curve? The area under the whole of the standard normal distribution is 1. We scale and shift any normal distribution to standard one and obtain the corresponding area.\nThere is a function called the Cumulative Density Function (CDF), which gives us the probability value for outcomes between a range (0 and 4, for example). A single line of code saved tons of time I would have spent calculating the z-score, looking up the table, etc. Python is convenient if you know how to use it.\nnorm(rolls_mean, rolls_std).cdf(4) 0.8176661208472158 B.3 What is the right \u0026rsquo;n\u0026rsquo; (sample size)? In section A.2, we looked at the importance of sample size. 500 was representative of the die throw averages, whereas 20 wasn\u0026rsquo;t. How do we determine the right sample size? This is, as we alluded previously, an important question. It\u0026rsquo;s problematic if someone performs an opinion poll, and makes inferences not knowing whether their data represents the population. As a science communicator, I read scientific papers and have to make judgements on whether the authors\u0026rsquo; claims are valid. The table is below taken from the lecture on opinion polls. It gives you the sample size estimates needed to make conclusive claims about a population given an error tolerance and confidence.\nHow to read the table? If we tolerate the error of 0.1 (meaning our value is plus or minus 0.1 away from true probability) and confidence of 90the odds estimation to be right 90%, the sample size needed is 68.\nPart C Find a report in the news, in current events, in an area you are fascinated by, that allows for a statistical analysis. What is the report? What question are you trying to answer by analysing the data? What parts of the story are relevant in answering your question? What smaller questions might you ask as stepping-stones? What information do you need to answer these questions? What statistical tools might you use to answer these questions? Note: you need not actually perform the analysis though you can certainly see how far you can push the models if you wish. (500 words maximum.)\nC.1 Crowdsourcing Data Analysis While working on the statistics group assignments, a question kept bugging me. We were all given the same problem statement and dataset. Yet, I\u0026rsquo;m sure our statistical analysis and inferences would be different. Of course, a minority of the groups would have gotten their numbers wrong, made wrong assumptions, etc. But the majority of us would have chosen a statistical tool with a justifiable reason, cleaned data on specific principles, and so on. Can such good-willed choices also lead to differences? The answer is yes.\nA study on crowdsourcing data analysis published in 2017 (Silberzahn et al.) looked into this problem systematically. They got 29 expert teams to analyse the same data set to address the same research question: whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players. The result was unexpected. There was no single conclusive answer to the research question. Quoting the paper, \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;no teams found a negative effect, 9 found no significant relationship, and 20 found a positive effect. If a single team, selected randomly from the present teams, had conducted the study using the same data set, there would have been a 69% probability of a positive estimated effect size and a 31% probability of a null effect.\u0026rdquo;\nThe authors of the study tried to analyse why there was such stark variance in the results. They looked at analysis approaches, analysts\u0026rsquo; beliefs, expertise, etc. Through peer rating and assessment, they found that none of these had an impact on the differences in the results.\nAll this means one thing: when dealing with analyses of complex data, variation is inevitable. This is concerning. If a medical study conducted \u0026ndash; with all good intentions and careful analysis \u0026ndash; claims a drug has a certain efficacy, can we really trust it? Can we ever trust any published statistical analysis at all?\nTo address the problem of inevitable variability in data analysis, the authors of the paper suggest crowdsourcing data analysis is one possible solution. Apart from crowdsourcing, the research community is also publishing reproduction and replication studies to validate a study\u0026rsquo;s claim. Reproduction is an attempt to arrive at comparable results with identical data using computational methods described in a paper. Replication involves generating new data and applying existing methods to achieve comparable results. What should the lone analyst do? In statistics, there are now tools to \u0026lsquo;mimic\u0026rsquo; crowdsourcing, where the analyst tries every different defensible analysis and systematically arrives at an inference. To sum it up, \u0026ldquo;the best defence against subjectivity in science is to expose it\u0026rdquo;.\nComing back to the bugging question of mine. I think it would be an interesting exercise to perform a similar metanalysis as described in the study for our group assignments to quantify the variations in the results of our analysis.\nReference Silberzahn R, Uhlmann EL, Martin DP, et al.

Including a new habit into your schedule takes effort.\nDaily Breakdown 2024-09-02 (Monday) Made my CV After struggling for many months to perfect my CV, I finally finished creating one. I was asked by a professor to share my CV so he could look for a potential PhD advisor if I\u0026rsquo;m interested in pursuing one. I used Superset CV builder. Although it was clunky (with edit widget being too small and it taking forever to load), it helped me format my CV and restrict it to a page. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;ve done a good job at describing my work experience. We were asked to use the PAR Framework (Problem-Action-Result), but I got to lazy and copy-pasted details from my older resumes and modified a bit for consistency.\nClasses In our Leadership class, we went over what Mission, Vision, Strategy and Values were. It seemed like the professor had gotten Mission and Vision swapped when he explained. In the later half of the class, we discussed what liberal arts education really meant.\nNotes I took while reading Surely You\u0026rsquo;re Joking book on the side\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t pay much attention to the history class. We were critically examining Rasosundari Devi\u0026rsquo;s autobiography, My Life. We discussed what we can and cannot conclude from it about the lives of women of the time, what an authetic piece of historical document is, what questions to ask before making inferences from such texts, etc.\n2024-09-03 (Tuesday) SD Project At the YIF, we work on a project as part of Experiential Learning Module (ELM). As a Fellow, you are expected to work on either an external or self-designed project for 10 months to gain real-world experience. Our team pitched a climate change game last week and Tuesday, we got to know that we had been waitlisted. It was a bit frustrating that they repeated the exact same feedback for which we had responded during the interview.\nWe frantically contacted mentors for the climate game as that was one of the requirements. Karan, the director of the YIF, helped as well. He got us to talk to Prof. Vijayraghavan (whom I had always wanted to talk to when I was at NCBS), and the Professor has agreed to mentor us. It was a quick but useful conversation. Later, we brainstormed to come up with a mock-up interface.\n2024-09-04 (Wednesday) Last history lecture. Professor\u0026rsquo;s story about M.K. Gandhi had me teary-eyed. I rushed to the library to get the last copy of Kamaladevi\u0026rsquo;s s biography before heading to the ELM team-building session. We had fun activities \u0026ndash; answering trick questions and building a cardboard bridge. We then reflected on how we worked as a team.\nLater that day, we met Meghna Agarwala, a professor of Environmental Studies, to discuss the game. It was intense, but some questions she asked like what\u0026rsquo;s the message you\u0026rsquo;d subtlely want to give through the game, who is your audience, etc. really made us think.\n2024-09-05 (Thursday) First, I had an optional DS. I attended it since I thought I had time. Made a cute vision board for myself.\nWhere I would like to be in 5 years. Zoom in to read\n2024-09-06 (Friday) We had a half a day\u0026rsquo;s session on design thinking. It was fun. I spent the rest of my day working on the individual statistics assignment.\nCheck out my statistics assignment, here.\nAND we got to know that our ELM project had been accepted!\n2024-09-07 (Saturday) I had ELM sessions in the morning, which were semi-useful. We were taught how to define our problem statements. We were also given a rough timeline for the term. For the rest of the day, I was immersed in reading Kamaladevi\u0026rsquo;s biography. I\u0026rsquo;m geninunely in awe with her. I drafted part of the assignment, and called it a day.\n2024-09-08 (Sunday) Final assignment submission for term 01. Woke to fire alarm ringing at 0650. Turn out the alarm had malfunctioned. I was going to wake up at 0700 to do finish my assignment anyway, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t lose sleep unintendedly. I started off by adding context to the quotes I had picked from Nico Slate\u0026rsquo;s biography on Kamaladevi. Half way through, I had to stop writing in between to learn how to cite with page numbers. A useful skill. The essay really came together in the last half an hour. I\u0026rsquo;m happy I managed to make all the arguments although not in the grandier fashion I had imagined in my brain.\nRelaxed for the rest of the day.\nCheck out my history assignment here\nWeek in Summary Phew, had a lot of ups and downs this week. I\u0026rsquo;m proud of how my assignments turned out. I\u0026rsquo;m super pumped that our SD got accepted and that I\u0026rsquo;ll get to interact with Prof. Vijayraghavan more.\nReadings [Paper] Many Analysts, One Data Set: Making Transparent How Variations in Analytic Choices Affect Results A well-written paper on crowdsourcing analysis of data. Same data, same research questions and multiple teams. What the researchers who crowdsourced found was that even when everyone uses the same data and make well-meaning defensible decisions on the statistical approach to tackle the question, there is a significant variation in the answers they get.\n[Book] Surely You\u0026rsquo;re Joking, Mr. Feynman Light read so far. Feynman is incredibly smart and he doesn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate one bit to show it off. I also didn\u0026rsquo;t know Feynman did biology for a year.\n[Book] Kamaladevi Chattopadhya: The Art of Freedom I had liked Kamaladevi during Prof. Mukherjee\u0026rsquo;s lectures, but I have newly found appreciation for her after reading parts of Nico Slate\u0026rsquo;s biography of her. I wish I was better at articulating, but I love how badass she is. The book opens with this scene of her building city, which comes to be called Faridabad, for migrants right after independence. She goes abroad when she was 18. She does drama, theatre, activism, travel, writing, crafts, everything. She rebels, breaks norms. She boldy imagines new India, where there is no caste, class and gender inequality, where everyone is able to experience the beauty of art.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/week-06-yif/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWeek 06 of the YIF.
