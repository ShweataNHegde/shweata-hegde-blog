I got selected for the Young India Fellowship (YIF) 2025. Taking a gap year after undergrad was risky, but I\u0026rsquo;m happy that it led me to the YIF. In a month\u0026rsquo;s time, I will be back to being a student. Probably for the first time, my education will be worthy of time and investment. What sold YIF for me is an that it\u0026rsquo;s all-in-one package. I\u0026rsquo;m learning history, economics, statistics, astrophysics, climate, leadership, writing, and many other disciplines and skills. And my peers are fully committed to the Fellowship, it seemed like! During my undergrad, none of us really wanted to learn from our classes. We didn\u0026rsquo;t engage in critical discussions or bother putting any efforts into assignments.\nWhy am I doing YIF? Currently in life, I\u0026rsquo;m lost. Having run IndiaAsksWhy and #semanticClimate with some success, I know it is to sustain projects and make a living out of them. How to get to a stage where I get to make an impact, but I want to get paid decently.\nAnd then, a lot happened over the gap year,\nI grew as a person. I was a free-bird when I graduated undergrad, but now I know I have responsibilities of myself and family. I didn\u0026rsquo;t strike the balance between work and life (hence dealing with sickness now). I was also flooded by failures and rejections, I lost confidence and felt burnt out. I\u0026rsquo;m not hoping for a magic solution from the YIF. But maybe I can connect with people with similar struggles and learn? Figure out what jobs fit me?\nAdvice for Myself These may sound generic, but to keep reminding myself, some advice:\nBe open to new people, ideas, and experiences Speak up Learn, make mistakes, learn Enjoy the fellowship. Be a part of the community Take care of physical and mental health; eat enough food Good luck to myself and all my peers from 2025 batch. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if the YIF lives upto its hype.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/young-india-fellowship/","summary":"Yay! I got selected for the Young India Fellowship (YIF) 2025.

The sun was not fully out in the morning. It suddenly rained in the afternoon. Later, the sun shone bright for a while before the pouring rain hit the ground.\nI took this picture late afternoon before the second rain. Funnily, I had never fully explored this part of the Old NCBS building. They have nice outdoor spaces!\nAs I took the picture, I realised how my time here at the BLiSc campus resembles today\u0026rsquo;s weather. I had a gloomy start, things went downhill, but I pulled myself back up for some sunshine moments, and now it\u0026rsquo;s back to being gloomy again. It\u0026rsquo;s been a wild three months. Living alone, exploring by myself, making and losing acquaintances, pulling together an international trip from scratch, running the podcast, navigating new workspace and tasks, and doing applications. No wonder I feel overwhelmed. But like there is beauty in these rain-soaked flowers facing the somewhat blue sky, there is one in my struggles and successes, too. I\u0026rsquo;ll have to keep chugging along. I\u0026rsquo;m grateful to this place for its lessons.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/blisc-lessons/","summary":"Today\u0026rsquo;s weather was weird.

I have an exam in two hours. But here I am, sitting on my bed facing the same pink curtain and the fairy light, reflecting on my time in Room No. 122. In a week, the room won\u0026rsquo;t be mine.\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but wonder about the stories the room holds, stories that I (or anyone who comes next) will never know. The hostel is close to 70 years old, which means more than 150 people lived in this room before me. And every person, inevitably, must have filled the room with have been filled with laughter, heartbreaks, gossip, love stories, fights, and more.\nOf course, I have contributed to the room\u0026rsquo;s collective memory by growing so much as a person. Sitting on this bed, I developed my website and indiaaskswhy.org, single-handedly planned a major event (Climate Knowledge Hunt Hackathon Sep. edition), and conquered my stage fear by taking demo classes. I also made new friends and connections and hosted private concerts for my gals :)\nI also raged in anger when the water in the washroom stopped so many times. The wing has water issues; incoming people stay warned. I\u0026rsquo;ve agonized over studying useless and outdated stuff and doing pointless assignments. But I learnt to be patient.\n122, thank you for keeping me sheltered while I brewed crazy plans. My gals, I\u0026rsquo;m grateful for bearing with me. I cannot imagine my hostel life without you two \u0026ndash; Kir and Nav.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve lost and found myself multiple times. I lived my life here, and it\u0026rsquo;s time to leave. The room will hit a lull now. But not for long. The new kids with wild dreams will soon arrive to revive this pink-walled windowless room (yes, there is one broken window) and add to the room\u0026rsquo;s ever-increasing memory.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/leave-and-let-live/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m in the middle of the exam season.
