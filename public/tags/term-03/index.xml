      <title>Term 03 | The New Geography of Information Age | Extension Notes 06: Is Censorship the Right Way to Go? Science Communication Perspective</title>

      <description>Given our conversation in class about the complex issue of censorship on social media, I explored the role of censorship in science communication. At first glance, one might argue that removing non-factual content, such as &amp;ldquo;vaccines cause autism&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;plant X has proven to cure Y disease,&amp;rdquo; might be the best option to prevent its further spread. However, the problem is that non-factual content is complicated and takes many forms—misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories—all of which require different approaches to address.</description>

      <title>Term 03 | The New Geography of Information Age | Extension Notes 06: My Aadhar Story</title>

      <description>As a family, we seldom went out to the town together; naturally, whenever we did, it was memorable. One such event was registering for our Aadhar cards. One day after school, my parents and I went to a registration center near the famous temple in the town. I had no idea what Aadhar was, and my parents did not explain it either. It was a small shop with benches, and it was unusually crowded.</description>

      <title>Term 03 | The New Geography of Information Age | Extension Notes 05: Split Brain Experiment: Is it Oversimplified?</title>

      <description>As someone who studied biology during undergrad, I was surprised to have not heard about the Split Brain Experiment (which probably shows my slight disinterest in neuroscience). Prof. Debayan’s descriptions of patients behaving oddly after their callosotomy—a procedure disconnecting the two halves of the brain—made me probe further.
Searching YouTube landed me on the most popular video on this topic by the CGP Grey channel. It described the experiments conducted in the late 19th century on split-brain patients by Sperry et al.</description>

      <title>Term 03 | The New Geography of Information Age | Extension Notes 04: Anti-vaxxers---Where Are They</title>

      <description>Anti-Vaxxers &amp;ndash; Where Are They? Decades of research show that vaccines save lives. However, there are communities of people known as anti-vaxxers who hesitate or refuse to get vaccinated. When faced with devastating pandemics like COVID-19, this &amp;ldquo;vaccine hesitancy&amp;rdquo; poses a threat to humanity. The advent of social media has only complicated the issue, providing opportunities for anti-vaxxers to spread misinformation.
As part of the Extension Notes, I looked at YouTube comments on:</description>

      <title>Term 03 | The New Geography of Information Age | Extension Notes 03: Reviewing &#39;Mother of All Demos&#39;</title>

      <description>Having given a few tech demos, Prof. Debayan’s mention of Douglas Engelbart&amp;rsquo;s “Mother of All Demos (1968)” made me curious to watch it. The presentation was given at a conference in conjunction with a conference paper titled “A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect.”
Engelbart showcased the oNLine System&amp;rsquo;s (NLS) features, such as file systems, text editors, and so on. He mentioned that his team used the consoles for “daily work,” perhaps making these the first-ever personal computers.</description>

      <title>Term 03 | The New Geography of Information Age | Extension Notes 02: Blockchain for Scientific Publishing</title>

      <description>After listening to Prof. Debayan explain blockchain, I started looking for avenues, apart from cryptocurrencies, where such a decentralized system could be used. Previously, as part of a research project, I had spent a considerable amount of time understanding the current scientific publishing ecosystem, only to realize that it lacks transparency and is gatekept by a few companies. Further, the competitive nature of scientific publishing has caused nuanced problems, such as p-hacking, data fudging, and the reproducibility crisis.</description>

      <description>Understanding Big Data Analysis Behind Recommender Systems and Other Algorithms
Despite friends discussing targeted advertising and giant companies tracking online activities, I had not bothered learning more about cookies or user profiling. I knew enough to ensure I checked the “Reject All” option whenever I visited a website, but I did not know the implications of not doing so. As Prof. Debayan explained how ad companies such as DoubleClick track me across websites to gather insights about my preferences and thereby show relevant advertisements, I became aware of my ignorance.</description>

      <description>Term 03 officially begins. I am excited for the courses this time. We have Microeconomics and The New Geography in the Information Age (NGIA) &amp;ndash; a funky name but it is a course on information in the age of internet. This week features me singing, reading a lot, working on Chevening Application, spending time with the cohort and having quality time with Karthik.
2024-10-28 First day of Term 03. We had to back-to-back lectures.</description>
