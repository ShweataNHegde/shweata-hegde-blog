      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;m writing the account a week later, it&amp;rsquo;ll be brief.
We had the last set of Art Appreciation classes. We looked at different art movements &amp;ndash; renaissance to performance art. I performed My Heart Will Go On in the farewell class. I got nervous, yet again. Being around talented people all the time can do that for you.
I spent the first half of the week writing the Expression of Interest to have Prof.</description>

      <description>2024-09-16 Monday began with breakfast in bed and trip to the infirmary. I was told that I might have caught a stomach bug. Slept all day except to eat and shit multiple times.
2024-09-17 Repeat of Monday. Spent a lot of time talking to Karthik and scrolling on phone.
2024-09-18 Slept all day again. Felt slightly better. It was interesting how my life was just about surviving one day at a time.</description>

      <description>Time is flying! New term from this week. We have two interesting courses, Art Appreciation (by Prof. Anunaya Chaubey) and Shakespeare and the World (Prof. Jonathan Gil Harris and Prof. Madhavi Menon).
Daily Breakdown 2024-09-09 I had an uncomfortable experience during the first Art Appreciation class. Prof. asked to paint a canvas in an hour, give it a title, make note of challenges and display. I made an embarassingly bad painting.</description>

      <description>Week 06 of the YIF. I have been meaning to document learnings since Week 01, but I never found the time. Including a new habit into your schedule takes effort.
Daily Breakdown 2024-09-02 (Monday) Made my CV After struggling for many months to perfect my CV, I finally finished creating one. I was asked by a professor to share my CV so he could look for a potential PhD advisor if I&amp;rsquo;m interested in pursuing one.</description>

      <description>In July 2022, all my undergrad classmates were hustling to figure out Masters, jobs, etc. On the other hand, I boldly decided to take a year off. No plans. A year for myself.
Thus the adventurous journey began, journey that took me to 5 big cities, and taught me life and career lessons. I am documenting experiences here for the future me to look back on.

      <description>Yay! I got selected to the Young India Fellowship (YIF) 2025. Taking a gap year after undergrad was risky, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy that it led me to the YIF. In a month&amp;rsquo;s time, I will be back to being a student. Probably for the first time, my education will be worthy of time and investment. What sold YIF for me is an that it&amp;rsquo;s all-in-one package. I&amp;rsquo;m learning history, economics, statistics, astrophysics, climate, leadership, writing, and many other disciplines and skills.</description>

      <title>A Random Day at BLiSc</title>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s weather was weird. The sun was not fully out in the morning. It suddenly rained in the afternoon. Later, the sun shone bright for a while before the pouring rain hit the ground.
I took this picture late afternoon before the second rain. Funnily, I had never fully explored this part of the Old NCBS building. They have nice outdoor spaces!
As I took the picture, I realised how my time here at the BLiSc campus resembles today&amp;rsquo;s weather.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of the exam season. I have an exam in two hours. But here I am, sitting on my bed facing the same pink curtain and the fairy light, reflecting on my time in Room No. 122. In a week, the room won&amp;rsquo;t be mine.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder about the stories the room holds, stories that I (or anyone who comes next) will never know. The hostel is close to 70 years old, which means more than 150 people lived in this room before me.</description>
