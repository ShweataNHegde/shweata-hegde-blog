      <description>&lt;p&gt;I meant to write more frequently, however, it seems like I have not managed to be disciplined enough yet again. As it is always the case, a LOT has happened. Any attempt to capture or document these few months would be an unfruitful exercise. Instead, I will quickly summarise some key events before resuming my usual weekly updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;term-4-2024-12-24-to-2025-01-10-making-videos-after-videos&#34;&gt;Term 4 (2024-12-24 to 2025-01-10): Making videos after videos!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After returning, I was immersed into a block-taught course called Visual Storytelling and Cinematic Techniques. Looking back, it was a very useful course. I, for the first time, learnt video production and acting. From direction insights such as camera angles, shot types, cutaways, continuity, to technicalities of video editing&amp;mdash;we learnt it all. Naturally, the classes were quite intense, packed from morning to evening. Additionally, our ELM had added responsibilities of preparing for the India Science Festival, where we were showcasing the board game version of Pralay. I still remember those cold and gloomy winter evenings, when I forced myself to get out of my room to meet the team to discuss the logistics of making the game. It all came together at the very last moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Term 05 | Climate Change: The Challenge of Communication</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my final term assignment for the Climate and Geopolitics course at the Young India Fellowship, I was doing some readings about the likelihood of exceeding the maximum wet-bulb temperature (the measure of the combination temperature and humidity) due to anthropogenic climate change. The papers were technical, however, I knew enough scientific jargon to grasp the apocalypse predicted. One of the papers read, “under RCP8.5, a small fraction of the South Asian population (~4%) is projected to experience TWmax [maximum wet bulb temperature] exceeding 35°C by 2100. However, approximately 75% of the population is projected to experience TWmax exceeding 31°C, considered dangerous levels for most humans…” (Im et al.). This made me wonder: Are the people living in the regions-to-be-affected aware of the future they are about to face, let alone be prepared? Worse, “the geographical locations of the most extreme projected heat waves in the Indus and Ganges river valleys coincide largely with locations of highly vulnerable human populations in terms of population density, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and agricultural intensity” (Im et al.). How does one even talk about future projections when these vulnerable communities have more immediate problems of livelihood and survival to deal with in the present?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
