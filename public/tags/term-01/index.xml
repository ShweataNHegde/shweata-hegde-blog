      <description>One of the assignments was to make a video about ourself. I was quite apprehensive at first. But I realised it&amp;rsquo;s a good practice to concisely tell a story about yourself. This is my attempt at telling a story about how I got into science communication.</description>

      <description>Over the course, we had 4 group assignments, which required us to use statistical tools like z-score, t-test, chi-squared test, etc in various scenarios. I decided to use Python to do all analyses. Looking back, it was a nice way to practice coding while also learning new concepts.

      <description>Through the course, I learnt about various statistical tools and concept. But I also explored how to run them in Python. So, it only makes sense for my final report to be an interactive Python file.

      <description>Week 06 of the YIF. I have been meaning to document learnings since Week 01, but I never found the time. Including a new habit into your schedule takes effort.
Daily Breakdown 2024-09-02 (Monday) Made my CV After struggling for many months to perfect my CV, I finally finished creating one. I was asked by a professor to share my CV so he could look for a potential PhD advisor if I&amp;rsquo;m interested in pursuing one.</description>
