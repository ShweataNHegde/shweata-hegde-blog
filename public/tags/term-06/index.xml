      <title>Term 06 | Can Scientific Temperament Help Build a Better Welfare State?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most rhetoric about the welfare state revolves around the mechanics and politics of schemes related to social protection, social assistance, and social rights such as—education, healthcare, food, and employment. However, abstracting our way out from this detailed perspective and instead looking at the Welfare State as a whole, we realise that “the welfare state is a distinctive form of governmentality: a specific mode of constituting the economy, assuring social security, and guaranteeing social provision (Garland, D., 2014)”. In this essay, I argue that scientific temperament should be one of the core pillars—if not the pillar—of this form of governmentality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a student of science and education at a government college, I had no encouragement to keep up with current affairs. After all, my tasks were that of “pure science” like running experiments in labs. However, as years passed, I started having a more outward look, beyond the lab, and realised that science happens not in isolation. The very establishment where I perform experiments is shaped by societal context, and most importantly, local, national and global politics. For instance, if the funding agencies decided to cut funding to my institution, I would not have the chemicals to perform experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Term 06 | Op-Ed | India&#39;s Foreign Policy | Wildlife To Bring Together India and Pakistan?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Twin orphaned bear cubs given shelter near India-Pakistan border”, read a Reuters News headline. In 2021, two Asiatic Bear cubs were found on the Pakistani side of Kashmir. Unable to open their eyes, the cubs could barely manage to crawl away from the border. Their mother? She was never to be found on the Pakistani side; she was probably killed at the Indian border, either due to the fencing or landmines. The long-standing disputes between India and Pakistan have led to the two countries taking extreme measures; the electric fence being one of them. The fencing of the Line Of Control (LoC) completed in 2004 was meant to prevent the illegal entry of militants. But it has inadvertently also caused incredible damage to habitats at the border—spanning cold deserts, mountains and hot deserts. Locals and forest officials on both sides of the border recount countless stories of lost wildlife—such as separated cubs, deer injured by landmines, or leopards killed for human safety—all as a direct consequence of border control and fencing. But who is to listen? Both countries are too busy strategising their next wars or attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Term 06 | The Welfare State | Critical Reading Notes on Bread For All (Introduction)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-06-the-welfare-state-critical-notes-02/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading excerpts from Bread For All by Chris Renwick was my first introduction to Social History. I found Social History fascinating because it weaves together the lived experiences of people from the past. What piqued my interest was how there are certain culminating events in history—such as the Beveridge Report becoming popular—but the event in itself does not tell us the whole story. It is only when we situate that event in the mundane of every day and look at the ideas of the time, does the real picture of the past emerges. In that regard, I was drawn to the work of journalist Charles Madge, the anthropologist Tom Harrisson, and the filmmaker Humphrey Jennings in documenting the “Collective unconscious” through  “Mass-Observations”.  In particular, there was this statement on why British people, particularly middle-class people, were having smaller families than they had in the past, which read: “People lacked faith in the future. Not a belief that things are going to be tough, and it will take a long time to get right &amp;hellip; But a belief that nobody’s going to try and put things right and improve them, that the nation is going to muddle on through the chaoses [sic] of another 1919–39 to another world war in 1965.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Term 06 | The Welfare State | Critical Reading Notes On Right to Healthcare in Times of Universal Health Coverage</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At my previous workplace, I was involved in public health communication for rare genetic diseases. Our team’s table read of the National Policy for Rare Diseases (NPRD), 2021, exposed me to the intricacies of India’s present-day healthcare system. We had extensive discussions about how essential services—such as genetic counseling, newborn screening, and early detection of non-communicable diseases—should be part of the Primary Health Care (PHC) system. Adding to these conversations was The India Forum article, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theindiaforum.in/health/right-healthcare-times-universal-health-coverage&#34;&gt;Right to Healthcare in Times of Universal Health Coverage&lt;/a&gt;, which gave me a framework to think about and possibly reimagine the healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;2025-03-03-to-2025-03-09&#34;&gt;2025-03-03 to 2025-03-09&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Term 06 has begun. We have &amp;ldquo;Deconstructing Indian Foreign Policy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Welfare State&amp;rdquo;. These courses are very outside of my comfort zone. However, I have not been able to give these courses the time they deserve because of climate and WSCI presentations. I was disappointed by the fact that I did not get to present my climate group assignment; the professor cut me off because we were running late for dinner. Similarly, our WSCI project was also controversial in some sense, but I personally did not receive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
