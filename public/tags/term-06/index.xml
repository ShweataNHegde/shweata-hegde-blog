      <title>Term 06 | Can Scientific Temperament Help Build a Better Welfare State?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most rhetoric about the welfare state revolves around the mechanics and politics of schemes related to social protection, social assistance, and social rights such as—education, healthcare, food, and employment. However, abstracting our way out from this detailed perspective and instead looking at the Welfare State as a whole, we realise that “the welfare state is a distinctive form of governmentality: a specific mode of constituting the economy, assuring social security, and guaranteeing social provision (Garland, D., 2014)”. In this essay, I argue that scientific temperament should be one of the core pillars—if not the pillar—of this form of governmentality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Term 06 | Op-Ed | Need for a Science Policy Discourse in Formal Research Spaces</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a student of science and education at a government college, I had no encouragement to keep up with current affairs. After all, my tasks were that of “pure science” like running experiments in labs. However, as years passed, I started having a more outward look, beyond the lab, and realised that science happens not in isolation. The very establishment where I perform experiments is shaped by societal context, and most importantly, local, national and global politics. For instance, if the funding agencies decided to cut funding to my institution, I would not have the chemicals to perform experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Term 06 | Op-Ed | Wildlife To Bring Together India and Pakistan?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Twin orphaned bear cubs given shelter near India-Pakistan border”, read a Reuters News headline. In 2021, two Asiatic Bear cubs were found on the Pakistani side of Kashmir. Unable to open their eyes, the cubs could barely manage to crawl away from the border. Their mother? She was never to be found on the Pakistani side; she was probably killed at the Indian border, either due to the fencing or landmines. The long-standing disputes between India and Pakistan have led to the two countries taking extreme measures; the electric fence being one of them. The fencing of the Line Of Control (LoC) completed in 2004 was meant to prevent the illegal entry of militants. But it has inadvertently also caused incredible damage to habitats at the border—spanning cold deserts, mountains and hot deserts. Locals and forest officials on both sides of the border recount countless stories of lost wildlife—such as separated cubs, deer injured by landmines, or leopards killed for human safety—all as a direct consequence of border control and fencing. But who is to listen? Both countries are too busy strategising their next wars or attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;2025-03-03-to-2025-03-09&#34;&gt;2025-03-03 to 2025-03-09&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Term 06 has begun. We have &amp;ldquo;Deconstructing Indian Foreign Policy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Welfare State&amp;rdquo;. These courses are very outside of my comfort zone. However, I have not been able to give these courses the time they deserve because of climate and WSCI presentations. I was disappointed by the fact that I did not get to present my climate group assignment; the professor cut me off because we were running late for dinner. Similarly, our WSCI project was also controversial in some sense, but I personally did not receive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
