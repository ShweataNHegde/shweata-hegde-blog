      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;2025-03-03-to-2025-03-09&#34;&gt;2025-03-03 to 2025-03-09&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Term 06 has begun. We have &amp;ldquo;Deconstructing Indian Foreign Policy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Welfare State&amp;rdquo;. These courses are very outside of my comfort zone. However, I have not been able to give these courses the time they deserve because of climate and WSCI presentations. I was disappointed by the fact that I did not get to present my climate group assignment; the professor cut me off because we were running late for dinner. Similarly, our WSCI project was also controversial in some sense, but I personally did not receive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
