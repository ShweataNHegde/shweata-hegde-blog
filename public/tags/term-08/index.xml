      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we left to visit the Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium on the 31st of May, I was quite excited. As a science communicator, I enjoy interacting with public engagement systems in Indiaâ€”be it museums, galleries, open days, or conferences. As someone who curates events for the public, it is sometimes good to become part of the public, experience the events through the lens of a citizen. Despite it being a hot summer day, I was ready to explore the planetarium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Term 08 started and ended; before I even realised. The term was filled with anticipation, uncertainity, resisting change and gratefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the electives&amp;mdash;Exploring The Universe and Great Ideas, Hard Numbers&amp;mdash;were brilliant courses. Although slightly stressful at times, I enjoyed working on the assignments. Lectures were great fun, too. I asked the most number of questions in this final term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learnt how to swim, too. It was a very rewarding process. I can freestyle swim the breadth of the 25m pool. So, yay :) Joy of learning at its peak.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
