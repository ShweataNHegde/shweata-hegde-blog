      <description>had one of the most colorful weeks of 2024. December was indeed an interesting curveball I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting.
2024-12-22 The last day of Organizational Dynamics. It started at 09:30. The lectures were boring, honestly. In the afternoon, we were given the final group assignment to express our learnings from the course through a creative piece. Although I was initially hesitant, I ended up dancing with the group. It was definitely a memorable experience, and I am super grateful to my team.</description>
