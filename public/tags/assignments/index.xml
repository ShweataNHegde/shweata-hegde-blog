      <description>After living in Mysore (a quiet city in Karnataka) for most of my life, I moved to Bengaluru last year for work. Naturally, I bumped into more non-kannada-speaking folks than usual, and English became my go-to language. Nothing to fret about. All my life I’ve enjoyed speaking in English. I took pride in being fluent in the language at school and even college. I often said I think in English. I had no issues giving presentations, making points in meetings, or having casual conversations at the workplace.</description>

      <description>One of the assignments was to make a video about ourself. I was quite apprehensive at first. But I realised it&amp;rsquo;s a good practice to concisely tell a story about yourself. This is my attempt at telling a story about how I got into science communication.</description>

      <description>Over the course, we had 4 group assignments, which required us to use statistical tools like z-score, t-test, chi-squared test, etc in various scenarios. I decided to use Python to do all analyses. Looking back, it was a nice way to practice coding while also learning new concepts.

      <description>Through the course, I learnt about various statistical tools and concept. But I also explored how to run them in Python. So, it only makes sense for my final report to be an interactive Python file.
# Import packages from scipy.stats import norm import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import random import seaborn as sns Part A Choose three of the four following statistical tools (A.1 – A.4). For each of your chosen three, write a short response exhibiting your understanding of the tool (250 words maximum each).</description>
