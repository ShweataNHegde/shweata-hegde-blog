      <description>Past 15 days of Organisational Dynamics course has been a mush. I am constantly startled by the fact that it has only been running for the past 15 days. Feels like life has been this 0900 to 1900 grind forever. Simulations, readings, co-education, instructor-led group discussions&amp;mdash;argh, I was always surrounded by people. Some days were great, others weren&amp;rsquo;t. However, it was the very same people who made it easier. I grew closer to my cohort and am finally starting to feel like I belong.</description>
