      <title>Week 42 | The Young India Fellowship</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I never quite managed to post here again, despite having a rather light term. Times have changed very much. I think it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say that I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will ever have a &amp;rsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; educational experience, without any global challenges jeopardising it. India-Pakistan conflict has intensified over the last week. My heart goes out to all the people the bordering regions on both sides. Although I am priveleged enough to not having to worry about a missile hitting my building (not yet, at least), I still can&amp;rsquo;t help but be anxious, consume as much news as possible. I want to go back home. I am worried that I might get landlocked if I don&amp;rsquo;t act swiftly. But, on the other hand, I feel guilty whenever thoughts of fleeing down to the south comes to mind. What about those who don&amp;rsquo;t have the option of traveling back home? What of those who cannot afford to go back home? I feel selfish for choosing me over others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The new term finally began :) After tireless days working on ELM presentations, game nights, interviews, essays and assignments, we made it out of the busiest period of the Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really excited (I still am) for all three of my courses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design Thinking and Innovation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language Politics and Society&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sustainable Development: How Can We Align Social Justice, Biodiversity Conservation and Climate Action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this will be one of my favourite terms after term 01 where we had statistics and history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
