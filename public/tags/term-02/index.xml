      <description>Days: 2024-10-07 to 2024-10-20
Final two weeks of Term 02, Week 11 and 12, were filled with deadlines. As a result, I was stressed, confused, tired, agititated (fought with Karthik quite a lot). I feel like or even have the time to journal as you can tell. But we have made it through. Here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt at recounting key events from the two weeks.
At glance, here was my deadline list.</description>

      <description>2024-09-30 Thanks to the stage reading sessions, I fully read The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet. Later in the evening, we had the first lecture where we discussed the play. I finally get how literature classroom discussions work. Prof. Menon only posed questions and kept probing for answers from us. We collectively make sense of the concepts by contributing our understandings. It&amp;rsquo;s very rare for a STEM class to be democratic like that.</description>

      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;m writing the account a week later, it&amp;rsquo;ll be brief.
We had the last set of Art Appreciation classes. We looked at different art movements &amp;ndash; renaissance to performance art. I performed My Heart Will Go On in the farewell class. I got nervous, yet again. Being around talented people all the time can do that for you.
I spent the first half of the week writing the Expression of Interest to have Prof.</description>

      <description>2024-09-16 Monday began with breakfast in bed and trip to the infirmary. I was told that I might have caught a stomach bug. Slept all day except to eat and shit multiple times.
2024-09-17 Repeat of Monday. Spent a lot of time talking to Karthik and scrolling on phone.
2024-09-18 Slept all day again. Felt slightly better. It was interesting how my life was just about surviving one day at a time.</description>

      <description>Time is flying! New term from this week. We have two interesting courses, Art Appreciation (by Prof. Anunaya Chaubey) and Shakespeare and the World (Prof. Jonathan Gil Harris and Prof. Madhavi Menon).
Daily Breakdown 2024-09-09 I had an uncomfortable experience during the first Art Appreciation class. Prof. asked to paint a canvas in an hour, give it a title, make note of challenges and display. I made an embarassingly bad painting.</description>
