      <description>&lt;p&gt;Days: 2024-10-07 to 2024-10-20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final two weeks of Term 02, Week 11 and 12, were filled with deadlines. As a result, I was stressed, confused, tired, agititated (fought with Karthik quite a lot). I feel like or even have the time to journal as you can tell. But we have made it through. Here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt at recounting key events from the two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At glance, here was my deadline list. Art Appreciation and Shakespeare combined, I had 5 assignments, a conference presentation (The Tech We Want), meeting with Prof. Vijayraghavan, a scholarship application (I discontinued working on it).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Term 02 | Art Appreciation Final Essay | The Power of Scientific Illustrations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“To develop a complete mind: Study the science of art; study the art of science. Learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else.” - Leonardo Da Vinci&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a non-artist in biology classes, I was always in awe of botany and zoology professors who drew detailed diagrams of, let’s say, a dissected flower part or insect organ on the chalkboard. The professors captured all the details a photograph would, except that the diagram was better at spotlighting the key characteristics of the specimen. To draw such a detailed diagram, one observes patiently and records — skills valuable to any researcher. Therefore, as biology students, we were encouraged to draw, even if we didn’t come with the skillset of an artist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Term 02 | Art Appreciation Final Painting</title>

&lt;p&gt;Geometric patterns are fascinating; the more you look at them, the more they reveal. Like craftsmen from ancient times, I created this geometric pattern on the canvas by drawing circles and lines. The colours chosen for the motifs uncover various perspectives to observe the pattern. Pause and discover what this pattern reveals to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geometric pattern painted is adapted from the book, &amp;ldquo;Islamic Geometric Pattern&amp;rdquo; by Eric Broug.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the stage reading sessions, I fully read &lt;em&gt;The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt;. Later in the evening, we had the first lecture where we discussed the play. I finally get how literature classroom discussions work. Prof. Menon only posed questions and kept probing for answers from us. We collectively make sense of the concepts by contributing our understandings. It&amp;rsquo;s very rare for a STEM class to be democratic like that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;m writing the account a week later, it&amp;rsquo;ll be brief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had the last set of Art Appreciation classes. We looked at different art movements &amp;ndash; renaissance to performance art. I performed My Heart Will Go On in the farewell class. I got nervous, yet again. Being around talented people all the time can do that for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the first half of the week writing the Expression of Interest to have Prof. Vijayraghavan as my mentor at the YIF. I have been an advocate for open science since I learnt about it. But in writing to Prof. Vijayraghavan, I collated by scattered thoughts about open science in India to coherent narrative. I collasced my interests in science communication and open science. Prathima Muniyappa, an alum of the YIF, had told me about thinking in first principles. I finally noticed commonality two separate career trajectories of mine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;2024-09-16&#34;&gt;2024-09-16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday began with breakfast in bed and trip to the infirmary. I was told that I might have caught a stomach bug. Slept all day except to eat and shit multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2024-09-17&#34;&gt;2024-09-17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeat of Monday. Spent a lot of time talking to Karthik and scrolling on phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2024-09-18&#34;&gt;2024-09-18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slept all day again. Felt slightly better. It was interesting how my life was just about surviving one day at a time. I also discovered that social media has changed a lot since I last checked in. I stumbled across a lot of regional &amp;lsquo;content creators&amp;rsquo;. Gone are the days where there was little Indian representation online.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time is flying! New term from this week. We have two interesting courses, Art Appreciation (by Prof. Anunaya Chaubey) and Shakespeare and the World (Prof. Jonathan Gil Harris and Prof. Madhavi Menon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;daily-breakdown&#34;&gt;Daily Breakdown&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2024-09-09&#34;&gt;2024-09-09&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an uncomfortable experience during the first Art Appreciation class. Prof. asked to paint a canvas in an hour, give it a title, make note of challenges and display. I made an embarassingly bad painting. I was almost in tears after looking around and seeing amazing art works. I felt even worse because of how I reacted. I wish I was slightly better at dealing with being sucky at something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
