      <description>Time is flying! New term from this week. We have two interesting courses, Art Appreciation (by Prof. Anunaya Chaubey) and Shakespeare and the World (Prof. Jonathan Gil Harris and Prof. Madhavi Menon).
Daily Breakdown 2024-09-09 I had an uncomfortable experience during the first Art Appreciation class. Prof. asked to paint a canvas in an hour, give it a title, make note of challenges and display. I made an embarassingly bad painting.</description>

      <description>2024-09-16 Monday began with breakfast in bed and trip to the infirmary. I was told that I might have caught a stomach bug. Slept all day except to eat and shit multiple times.
2024-09-17 Repeat of Monday. Spent a lot of time talking to Karthik and scrolling on phone.
2024-09-18 Slept all day again. Felt slightly better. It was interesting how my life was just about surviving one day at a time.</description>
