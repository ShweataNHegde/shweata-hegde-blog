    <p>2025-03-12 As mentioned in my catch-up post, I have been shortlisted for Chevening interview. Ever since I heard the news on the 14th Feb., I have been excited and anxious. However, anxiety is slowly taking over. It’s been over a month, and I don’t think I have put enough efforts to prepare. I still don’t know how I would answer most of the questions. What kind of funny human am I? I really want the scholarship, but I am not able to actively work towards telling my story in the interview. I am overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information and advice online. What to focus on? What is relevant to me? I am also overwhelmed by the difficulty of the challenge ahead of me. With 50 students being selected for the scholarship, my probabilities of getting it is so low. Knowing this piece of information has only inhibited me from preparing for the interview, which as I write out, sounds so counter-intuitive. Shouldn’t I be preparing more rigoursly?

    <p>2025-03-03 to 2025-03-09 Term 06 has begun. We have “Deconstructing Indian Foreign Policy” and “The Welfare State”. These courses are very outside of my comfort zone. However, I have not been able to give these courses the time they deserve because of climate and WSCI presentations. I was disappointed by the fact that I did not get to present my climate group assignment; the professor cut me off because we were running late for dinner. Similarly, our WSCI project was also controversial in some sense, but I personally did not receive feedback.

    <p>I meant to write more frequently, however, it seems like I have not managed to be disciplined enough yet again. As it is always the case, a LOT has happened. Any attempt to capture or document these few months would be an unfruitful exercise. Instead, I will quickly summarise some key events before resuming my usual weekly updates.
Term 4 (2024-12-24 to 2025-01-10): Making videos after videos! After returning, I was immersed into a block-taught course called Visual Storytelling and Cinematic Techniques. Looking back, it was a very useful course. I, for the first time, learnt video production and acting. From direction insights such as camera angles, shot types, cutaways, continuity, to technicalities of video editing—we learnt it all. Naturally, the classes were quite intense, packed from morning to evening. Additionally, our ELM had added responsibilities of preparing for the India Science Festival, where we were showcasing the board game version of Pralay. I still remember those cold and gloomy winter evenings, when I forced myself to get out of my room to meet the team to discuss the logistics of making the game. It all came together at the very last moment.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>2024—the year full of turbulence. After crusing through 2022 and 2023, 2024 felt like a reality check. When I look back on the year, I only see disappointments, rejections, fights, poor health and lost confidence. However, all of the experiences have also taught me life lessons. Hopefully, as a result, I find myself more resilient in the years to come.
I spent the first half of the year doing applications, getting rejections and some acceptances. It was stressful to balance work at TIGS and write compelling applications. TIGS sadly never was a fertile ground for my ideas to grow. I felt undervalued and I couldn’t deliver my best either. The experience overall made me doubt whether I would make a good science communicator. I also fell sick in March and I never felt healthy since then. After many deliberations I decided to the Young India Fellowship. I was unsure if it was going to be useful and whether I would be able to manage the workload. Giving up my dream of doing a Masters abroad was hard, too.

    <p>I had one of the most colorful weeks of 2024. December was indeed an interesting curveball I wasn’t expecting.
2024-12-22 The last day of Organizational Dynamics. It started at 0930. The lectures were boring, honestly. In the afternoon, we were given the final group assignment to express our learnings from the course through a creative piece. Although I was initially hesitant, I ended up dancing with the group. It was definitely a memorable experience, and I am super grateful to my team.
