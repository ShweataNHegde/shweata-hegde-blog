      <title>Term 03 | The New Geography of Information Age | Extension Notes 06: Is Censorship the Right Way to Go? Science Communication Perspective</title>

      <description>Given our conversation in class about the complex issue of censorship on social media, I explored the role of censorship in science communication. At first glance, one might argue that removing non-factual content, such as &amp;ldquo;vaccines cause autism&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;plant X has proven to cure Y disease,&amp;rdquo; might be the best option to prevent its further spread. However, the problem is that non-factual content is complicated and takes many forms—misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories—all of which require different approaches to address.</description>

      <title>Term 03 | The New Geography of Information Age | Extension Notes 06: My Aadhar Story</title>

      <description>As a family, we seldom went out to the town together; naturally, whenever we did, it was memorable. One such event was registering for our Aadhar cards. One day after school, my parents and I went to a registration center near the famous temple in the town. I had no idea what Aadhar was, and my parents did not explain it either. It was a small shop with benches, and it was unusually crowded.</description>

      <title>Term 03 | The New Geography of Information Age | Extension Notes 05: Split Brain Experiment: Is it Oversimplified?</title>

      <description>As someone who studied biology during undergrad, I was surprised to have not heard about the Split Brain Experiment (which probably shows my slight disinterest in neuroscience). Prof. Debayan’s descriptions of patients behaving oddly after their callosotomy—a procedure disconnecting the two halves of the brain—made me probe further.
Searching YouTube landed me on the most popular video on this topic by the CGP Grey channel. It described the experiments conducted in the late 19th century on split-brain patients by Sperry et al.</description>

      <title>Term 03 | The New Geography of Information Age | Extension Notes 04: Anti-vaxxers---Where Are They</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/assignments/term-03-ngia-essay-04/</link>

      <description>Anti-Vaxxers &amp;ndash; Where Are They? Decades of research show that vaccines save lives. However, there are communities of people known as anti-vaxxers who hesitate or refuse to get vaccinated. When faced with devastating pandemics like COVID-19, this &amp;ldquo;vaccine hesitancy&amp;rdquo; poses a threat to humanity. The advent of social media has only complicated the issue, providing opportunities for anti-vaxxers to spread misinformation.
As part of the Extension Notes, I looked at YouTube comments on:</description>

      <title>Term 03 | The New Geography of Information Age | Extension Notes 03: Reviewing &#39;Mother of All Demos&#39;</title>

      <description>Having given a few tech demos, Prof. Debayan’s mention of Douglas Engelbart&amp;rsquo;s “Mother of All Demos (1968)” made me curious to watch it. The presentation was given at a conference in conjunction with a conference paper titled “A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect.”
Engelbart showcased the oNLine System&amp;rsquo;s (NLS) features, such as file systems, text editors, and so on. He mentioned that his team used the consoles for “daily work,” perhaps making these the first-ever personal computers.</description>

      <title>Term 03 | The New Geography of Information Age | Extension Notes 02: Blockchain for Scientific Publishing</title>

      <description>After listening to Prof. Debayan explain blockchain, I started looking for avenues, apart from cryptocurrencies, where such a decentralized system could be used. Previously, as part of a research project, I had spent a considerable amount of time understanding the current scientific publishing ecosystem, only to realize that it lacks transparency and is gatekept by a few companies. Further, the competitive nature of scientific publishing has caused nuanced problems, such as p-hacking, data fudging, and the reproducibility crisis.</description>

      <description>Understanding Big Data Analysis Behind Recommender Systems and Other Algorithms
Despite friends discussing targeted advertising and giant companies tracking online activities, I had not bothered learning more about cookies or user profiling. I knew enough to ensure I checked the “Reject All” option whenever I visited a website, but I did not know the implications of not doing so. As Prof. Debayan explained how ad companies such as DoubleClick track me across websites to gather insights about my preferences and thereby show relevant advertisements, I became aware of my ignorance.</description>

      <description>“To develop a complete mind: Study the science of art; study the art of science. Learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else.” - Leonardo Da Vinci
As a non-artist in biology classes, I was always in awe of botany and zoology professors who drew detailed diagrams of, let’s say, a dissected flower part or insect organ on the chalkboard. The professors captured all the details a photograph would, except that the diagram was better at spotlighting the key characteristics of the specimen.</description>

      <description>Circles and Lines Geometric patterns are fascinating; the more you look at them, the more they reveal. Like craftsmen from ancient times, I created this geometric pattern on the canvas by drawing circles and lines. The colours chosen for the motifs uncover various perspectives to observe the pattern. Pause and discover what this pattern reveals to you.
The geometric pattern painted is adapted from the book, &amp;ldquo;Islamic Geometric Pattern&amp;rdquo; by Eric Broug.</description>

      <description>After living in Mysore (a quiet city in Karnataka) for most of my life, I moved to Bengaluru last year for work. Naturally, I bumped into more non-kannada-speaking folks than usual, and English became my go-to language. Nothing to fret about. All my life I’ve enjoyed speaking in English. I took pride in being fluent in the language at school and even college. I often said I think in English. I had no issues giving presentations, making points in meetings, or having casual conversations at the workplace.</description>

      <description>One of the assignments was to make a video about ourself. I was quite apprehensive at first. But I realised it&amp;rsquo;s a good practice to concisely tell a story about yourself. This is my attempt at telling a story about how I got into science communication.</description>

      <description>Over the course, we had 4 group assignments, which required us to use statistical tools like z-score, t-test, chi-squared test, etc in various scenarios. I decided to use Python to do all analyses. Looking back, it was a nice way to practice coding while also learning new concepts.

      <description>Through the course, I learnt about various statistical tools and concept. But I also explored how to run them in Python. So, it only makes sense for my final report to be an interactive Python file.
# Import packages from scipy.stats import norm import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import random import seaborn as sns Part A Choose three of the four following statistical tools (A.1 – A.4). For each of your chosen three, write a short response exhibiting your understanding of the tool (250 words maximum each).</description>
